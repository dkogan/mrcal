This is a very simple C library to implement basic linear algebra routines for
small matrices. Libraries such as BLAS are highly optimized for large matrices,
but their overhead often makes them suboptimal for very small matrices. By
contrast, this library has very simple, predefined functions for the various
routines it supports. These functions are NOT at all optimized at the source
level, but they are simple, and the C compiler can generally do a very good job
optimizing these. All the routines are in a header, so the compiler is free to
aggressively inline the code, as it sees fit. Supported are various ways to
compute norms of vectors, multiply matrices and solve linear systems.

The suffix of every function determines where its output goes. The ..._vout
functions store their output in a new vector, generally given as the last
argument. The ..._vaccum functions are the same except the output is added to
the data already in that vector instead of overwriting. With neither of these
suffixes, the functions store their output into the vector pointed to by the
first argument. Many functions have ...._scaled flavors that can apply a scale
factor to the given operation. The scale factor is in the last argument.

Matrices are stored row-first. Dimensions are given col-first. Vectors are
treated as row vectors. So for instance, a '3x2' matrix M stored in double[]
{1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0} implies

    [ 1.0 2.0 ]
M = [ 3.0 4.0 ]
    [ 5.0 6.0 ]

a 3-vector v = [ 11.0 12.0 13.0 ] can be multiplied by M to compute v*M using the

mul_vec3_gen32_... family of functions.

Example:

#include <minimath.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
  double M[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0};
  double v[] = {11.0, 12.0, 13.0};

  mul_vec3_gen32(v, M);
  printf("%f %f\n", v[0], v[1]);
  return 0;
}



C99-compliant compiler required.
