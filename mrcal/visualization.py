    models = [mrcal.cameramodel(m) for m in model_filenames]
    plot1 = mrcal.show_geometry(models)

    # Solve a calibration problem. Visualize the resulting geometry AND the

    mrcal.optimize(intrinsics            = intrinsics,
                   extrinsics_rt_fromref = extrinsics_rt_fromref,
                   frames_rt_toref       = frames_rt_toref,
                   points                = points,
                   ...)
    plot2 = \
      mrcal.show_geometry(extrinsics_rt_fromref,
                          frames_rt_toref = frames_rt_toref,
                          points          = points,
                          xlabel          = 'Northing (m)',
                          ylabel          = 'Easting (m)',

This function visualizes the world described by a set of camera models. It shows

- The geometry of the cameras themselves. Each one is represented by the axes of
  its coordinate system

- The geometry of the calibration objects used to compute these models. These
  are shown only if available and requested

  - Available: The data comes either from the frames_rt_toref argument or from
    the first model.optimization_inputs() that is given. If we have both, we use
    the frames_rt_toref

  - Requested: if we're using frames_rt_toref then we show the calibration
    objects if show_calobjects. I.e. show_calobjects is treated as a boolean.

    If we're using a model.optimization_inputs() then we can have finer-grained
    control. if show_calobjects == 'all': we show ALL the calibration objects,
    observed by ANY camera. elif show_calobjects == 'thiscamera': we only show
    the calibration objects that were observed by the given camera at
    calibration time. As before, if we have multiple camera models with multiple
    optimization_inputs, we use the first one

This function can also be used to visualize the output (or input) of
mrcal.optimize(); the relevant parameters are all identical to those
mrcal.optimize() takes.

This function is the core of the mrcal-show-geometry tool.

All arguments except models_or_extrinsics_rt_fromref are optional.

Extra **kwargs are passed directly to gnuplotlib to control the plot.

ARGUMENTS

- models_or_extrinsics_rt_fromref: an iterable of mrcal.cameramodel objects or
  (6,) rt arrays. A array of shape (N,6) works to represent N cameras. If
  mrcal.cameramodel objects are given here and frames_rt_toref is omitted, we
  get the frames_rt_toref from the first model that provides
  optimization_inputs().

- cameranames: optional array of strings of labels for the cameras. If omitted,
  we use generic labels. If given, the array must have the same length as
  models_or_extrinsics_rt_fromref

- cameras_Rt_plot_ref: optional transformation(s). If omitted, we plot
  everything in the camera reference coordinate system. If given, we use a
  "plot" coordinate system with the transformation TO plot coordinates FROM the
  reference coordinates given in this argument. This argument can be given as an
  iterable of Rt transformations to use a different one for each camera (None
  means "identity"). Or a single Rt transformation can be given to use that one
  for ALL the cameras

- frames_rt_toref: optional array of shape (N,6). If given, each row of shape
  (6,) is an rt transformation representing the transformation TO the reference
  coordinate system FROM the calibration object coordinate system. The
  calibration object then MUST be defined by passing in valid object_width_n,
  object_height_n, object_spacing parameters. If frames_rt_toref is omitted or
  None, we look for this data in the given camera models. I look at the given
  models in order, and grab the frames from the first model that has them. If
  none of the models have this data and frames_rt_toref is omitted or NULL, then
  I don't plot any frames at all

- object_width_n: the number of horizontal points in the calibration object
  grid. Required only if frames_rt_toref is not None

- object_height_n: the number of vertical points in the calibration object grid.
  Required only if frames_rt_toref is not None

- object_spacing: the distance between adjacent points in the calibration
  object. A square object is assumed, so the vertical and horizontal distances
  are assumed to be identical. Required only if frames_rt_toref is not None

- calobject_warp: optional (2,) array describing the calibration board warping.
  None means "no warping": the object is flat. Used only if frames_rt_toref is
  not None. See the docs for mrcal.ref_calibration_object() for a description.

- points: optional array of shape (N,3). If omitted, we don't plot the observed
  points. If given, each row of shape (3,) is a point in the reference
  coordinate system.

- point_labels: optional dict from a point index to a string describing it.
  Points in this dict are plotted with this legend; all other points are plotted
  under a generic "points" legend. As many or as few of the points may be
  labelled in this way. If omitted, none of the points will be labelled
  specially. This is used only if points is not None

- show_calobjects: optional string defaults to 'all'. if show_calobjects: we
  render the observed calibration objects (if they are available in
  frames_rt_toref or model.optimization_inputs()['frames_rt_toref']; we look at
  the FIRST model that provides this data). If we have optimization_inputs and
  show_calobjects == 'all': we display the objects observed by ANY camera. elif
  show_calobjects == 'thiscamera': we only show those observed by THIS camera.

- axis_scale: optional scale factor for the size of the axes used to represent
  the cameras. Can be omitted to use some reasonable default size, but tweaking
  it might be necessary to make the plot look right. If less than 1 camera is
  given, this defaults to 1.0. If at least 2 cameras are given, we default to
  1/4 the distance between the FIRST pair of cameras

- extratitle: optional string to include in the title of the resulting plot.
  Used to extend the default title string. If kwargs['title'] is given, it is
  used directly, and the extratitle is ignored

- return_plot_args: boolean defaulting to False. if return_plot_args: we return
  a (data_tuples, plot_options) tuple instead of making the plot. The plot can
  then be made with gp.plot(*data_tuples, **plot_options). Useful if we want to
  include this as a part of a more complex plot

- **kwargs: optional arguments passed verbatim as plot options to gnuplotlib.
  Useful to make hardcopies, set the plot title, etc.

RETURNED VALUES

if not return_plot_args (the usual path): we return the gnuplotlib plot object.
The plot disappears when this object is destroyed (by the garbage collection,
for instance), so save this returned plot object into a variable, even if you're
not going to be doing anything with this object.

if return_plot_args: we return a (data_tuples, plot_options) tuple instead of
making the plot. The plot can then be made with gp.plot(*data_tuples,
**plot_options). Useful if we want to include this as a part of a more complex
plot

SYNOPSIS

    import gnuplotlib as gp
    import numpy as np

    ...

    # x is a one-dimensional array with samples that we want to compare to a
    # normal distribution. For instance:
    #   x = np.random.randn(10000) * 0.1 + 10

    binwidth = 0.01

    equation = \
        mrcal.fitted_gaussian_equation(x        = x,
                                       binwidth = binwidth)

    gp.plot(x,
            histogram       = True,
            binwidth        = binwidth,
            equation_above  = equation)

    # A plot pops ups displaying a histogram of the array x overlaid by an ideal
    # gaussian probability density function. This PDF corresponds to the mean
    # and standard deviation of the data, and takes into account the histogram
    # parameters to overlay nicely on top of it

Overlaying a ideal PDF on top of an empirical histogram requires a bit of math
to figure out the proper vertical scaling of the plotted PDF that would line up
with the histogram. This is evaluated by this function.

This function can be called in one of two ways:

- Passing the data in the 'x' argument. The statistics are computed from the
  data, and there's no reason to pass 'mean', 'sigma', 'N'

- Passing the statistics 'mean', 'sigma', 'N' instead of the data 'x'. This is
  useful to compare an empirical histogram with idealized distributions that are
  expected to match the data, but do not. For instance, we may want to plot the
  expected standard deviation that differs from the observed standard deviation

ARGUMENTS

- binwidth: the width of each bin in the histogram we will plot. This is the
  only required argument

- x: one-dimensional numpy array containing the data that will be used to
  construct the histogram. If given, (mean, sigma, N) must all NOT be given:
  they will be computed from x. If omitted, then all those must be given instead

- mean: mean the gaussian to plot. Must be given if and only if x is not given

- sigma: standard deviation of the gaussian to plot. Must be given if and only
  if x is not given

- N: the number of values in the dataset in the histogram. Must be given if and
  only if x is not given

- legend: string containing the legend of the curve in the plot. May be omitted
  or None to leave the curve unlabelled

RETURNED VALUES

String passable to gnuplotlib in the 'equation' or 'equation_above' plot option

    r'''Visualize the difference in projection between N models

SYNOPSIS

    models = ( mrcal.cameramodel('cam0-dance0.cameramodel'),
               mrcal.cameramodel('cam0-dance1.cameramodel') )

    mrcal.show_projection_diff(models)

    # A plot pops up displaying the projection difference between the two models

The operation of this tool is documented at
http://mrcal.secretsauce.net/differencing.html

This function visualizes the results of mrcal.projection_diff()

It is often useful to compare the projection behavior of two camera models. For
instance, one may want to validate a calibration by comparing the results of two
different chessboard dances. Or one may want to evaluate the stability of the
intrinsics in response to mechanical or thermal stresses.

In the most common case we're given exactly 2 models to compare. We then display
the projection difference as either a vector field or a heat map. If we're given
more than 2 models, then a vector field isn't possible and we instead display as
a heatmap the standard deviation of the differences between models 1..N and
model0.

The top-level operation of this function:

- Grid the imager
- Unproject each point in the grid using one camera model
- Apply a transformation to map this point from one camera's coord system to the
  other. How we obtain this transformation is described below
- Project the transformed points to the other camera
- Look at the resulting pixel difference in the reprojection

If implied_Rt10 is given, we simply use that as the transformation (this is
currently supported ONLY for diffing exactly 2 cameras). If implied_Rt10 is not
given, we estimate it. Several variables control this. Top-level logic:

  if intrinsics_only:
      Rt10 = identity_Rt()
  else:
      if focus_radius == 0:
          Rt10 = relative_extrinsics(models)
      else:
          Rt10 = implied_Rt10__from_unprojections()

The details of how the comparison is computed, and the meaning of the arguments
controlling this, are in the docstring of mrcal.projection_diff().

ARGUMENTS

- models: iterable of mrcal.cameramodel objects we're comparing. Usually there
  will be 2 of these, but more than 2 is possible. The intrinsics are used; the
  extrinsics are NOT.

- implied_Rt10: optional transformation to use to line up the camera coordinate
  systems. Most of the time we want to estimate this transformation, so this
  should be omitted or None. Currently this is supported only if exactly two
  models are being compared.

- gridn_width: optional value, defaulting to 60. How many points along the
  horizontal gridding dimension

- gridn_height: how many points along the vertical gridding dimension. If None,
  we compute an integer gridn_height to maintain a square-ish grid:
  gridn_height/gridn_width ~ imager_height/imager_width

- observations: optional value, defaulting to False. If observations: we overlay
  calibration-time observations on top of the difference plot. We should then
  see that more data produces more consistent results. If a special value of
  'dots' is passed, the observations are plotted as dots instead of points

- valid_intrinsics_region: optional boolean, defaulting to False. If True, we
  overlay the valid-intrinsics regions onto the plot. If the valid-intrinsics
  regions aren't available, we will silently omit them

- intrinsics_only: optional boolean, defaulting to False. If True: we evaluate
  the intrinsics of each lens in isolation by assuming that the coordinate
  systems of each camera line up exactly

- distance: optional value, defaulting to None. Has an effect only if not
  intrinsics_only. The projection difference varies depending on the range to
  the observed world points, with the queried range set in this 'distance'
  argument. If None (the default) we look out to infinity. We can compute the
  implied-by-the-intrinsics transformation off multiple distances if they're
  given here as an iterable. This is especially useful if we have uncertainties,
  since then we'll emphasize the best-fitting distances. If multiple distances
  are given, the generated plot displays the difference using the FIRST distance
  in the list

- use_uncertainties: optional boolean, defaulting to True. Used only if not
  intrinsics_only and focus_radius!=0. If True we use the whole imager to fit
  the implied-by-the-intrinsics transformation, using the uncertainties to
  emphasize the confident regions. If False, it is important to select the
  confident region using the focus_center and focus_radius arguments. If
  use_uncertainties is True, but that data isn't available, we report a warning,
  and try to proceed without.

- focus_center: optional array of shape (2,); the imager center by default. Used
  only if not intrinsics_only and focus_radius!=0. Used to indicate that the
  implied-by-the-intrinsics transformation should use only those pixels a
  distance focus_radius from focus_center. This is intended to be used if no
  uncertainties are available, and we need to manually select the focus region.

- focus_radius: optional value. If use_uncertainties then the default is LARGE,
  to use the whole imager. Else the default is min(width,height)/6. Used to
  indicate that the implied-by-the-intrinsics transformation should use only
  those pixels a distance focus_radius from focus_center. This is intended to be
  used if no uncertainties are available, and we need to manually select the
  focus region. To avoid computing the transformation, either pass
  focus_radius=0 (to use the extrinsics in the given models) or pass
  intrinsics_only=True (to use the identity transform).

- vectorfield: optional boolean, defaulting to False. By default we produce a
  heat map of the projection differences. If vectorfield: we produce a vector
  field instead. This is more busy, and is often less clear at first glance, but
  unlike a heat map, this shows the directions of the differences in addition to
  the magnitude. This is only valid if we're given exactly two models to compare

- vectorscale: optional value, defaulting to 1.0. Applicable only if
  vectorfield. The magnitude of the errors displayed in the vector field is
  often very small, and impossible to make out when looking at the whole imager.
  This argument can be used to scale all the displayed vectors to improve
  legibility.

- directions: optional boolean, defaulting to False. By default the plot is
  color-coded by the magnitude of the difference vectors. If directions: we
  color-code by the direction instead. This is especially useful if we're
  plotting a vector field. This is only valid if we're given exactly two models
  to compare

- cbmax: optional value, defaulting to 4.0. Sets the maximum range of the color
  map

- extratitle: optional string to include in the title of the resulting plot.
  Used to extend the default title string. If kwargs['title'] is given, it is
  used directly, and the extratitle is ignored

- return_plot_args: boolean defaulting to False. if return_plot_args: we return
  a (data_tuples, plot_options) tuple instead of making the plot. The plot can
  then be made with gp.plot(*data_tuples, **plot_options). Useful if we want to
  include this as a part of a more complex plot

- **kwargs: optional arguments passed verbatim as plot options to gnuplotlib.
  Useful to make hardcopies, etc

RETURNED VALUE

A tuple:

- if not return_plot_args (the usual path): the gnuplotlib plot object. The plot
  disappears when this object is destroyed (by the garbage collection, for
  instance), so save this returned plot object into a variable, even if you're
  not going to be doing anything with this object.

  if return_plot_args: a (data_tuples, plot_options) tuple. The plot can then be
  made with gp.plot(*data_tuples, **plot_options). Useful if we want to include
  this as a part of a more complex plot

- Rt10: the geometric Rt transformation in an array of shape (...,4,3). This is
  the relative transformation we ended up using, which is computed using the
  logic above (using intrinsics_only and focus_radius). if len(models)>2: this
  is an array of shape (len(models)-1,4,3), with slice i representing the
  transformation between camera 0 and camera i+1.

SYNOPSIS

    model = mrcal.cameramodel('xxx.cameramodel')

    mrcal.show_projection_uncertainty(model)

    ... A plot pops up displaying the expected projection uncertainty across the
    ... imager

This function uses the expected noise of the calibration-time observations to
estimate the uncertainty of projection of the final model. At calibration time we estimate

- The intrinsics (lens paramaters) of a number of cameras
- The extrinsics (geometry) of a number of cameras in respect to some reference
  coordinate system
- The poses of observed chessboards, also in respect to some reference
  coordinate system

All the coordinate systems move around, and all 3 of these sets of data have
some uncertainty. This tool takes into account all the uncertainties to report
an estimated uncertainty metric. See
http://mrcal.secretsauce.net/uncertainty.html for a detailed description of
the computation.

This function grids the imager, and reports an uncertainty for each point on the
grid. The resulting plot contains a heatmap of the uncertainties for each cell
in the grid, and corresponding contours.

Since the projection uncertainty is based on calibration-time observation
uncertainty, it is sometimes useful to see where the calibration-time
observations were. Pass observations=True to do that.

Since the projection uncertainty is based partly on the uncertainty of the
camera pose, points at different distance from the camera will have different
reported uncertainties EVEN IF THEY PROJECT TO THE SAME PIXEL. The queried
distance is passed in the distance argument. If distance is None (the default)
then we look out to infinity.

For each cell we compute the covariance matrix of the projected (x,y) coords,
and by default we report the worst-direction standard deviation. If isotropic:
we report the RMS standard deviation instead.

ARGUMENTS

- model: the mrcal.cameramodel object being evaluated

- gridn_width: optional value, defaulting to 60. How many points along the
  horizontal gridding dimension

- gridn_height: how many points along the vertical gridding dimension. If None,
  we compute an integer gridn_height to maintain a square-ish grid:
  gridn_height/gridn_width ~ imager_height/imager_width

- observed_pixel_uncertainty: optional value, defaulting to None. The
  uncertainty of the observed chessboard corners being propagated through the
  solve and projection. If omitted or None, this input uncertainty is inferred
  from the residuals at the optimum. Most people should omit this

- observations: optional value, defaulting to False. If observatoins:, we
  overlay calibration-time observations on top of the uncertainty plot. We
  should then see that more data produces more confident results. If a special
  value of 'dots' is passed, the observations are plotted as dots instead of
  points

- valid_intrinsics_region: optional boolean, defaulting to False. If True, we
  overlay the valid-intrinsics region onto the plot. If the valid-intrinsics
  region isn't available, we will silently omit it

- distance: optional value, defaulting to None. The projection uncertainty
  varies depending on the range to the observed point, with the queried range
  set in this 'distance' argument. If None (the default) we look out to
  infinity.

- isotropic: optional boolean, defaulting to False. We compute the full 2x2
  covariance matrix of the projection. The 1-sigma contour implied by this
  matrix is an ellipse, and we use the worst-case direction by default. If we
  want the RMS size of the ellipse instead of the worst-direction size, pass
  isotropic=True.

- cbmax: optional value, defaulting to 3.0. Sets the maximum range of the color
  map

- contour_increment: optional value, defaulting to None. If given, this will be
  used as the distance between adjacent contours. If omitted of None, a
  reasonable value will be estimated

- contour_labels_styles: optional string, defaulting to 'boxed'. The style of
  the contour labels. This will be passed to gnuplot as f"with labels
  {contour_labels_styles} nosurface". Can be used to box/unbox the label, set
  the color, etc. To change the font use contour_labels_font.

- contour_labels_font: optional string, defaulting to None, If given, this is
  the font string for the contour labels. Will be passed to gnuplot as f'set
  cntrlabel font "{contour_labels_font}"'

- extratitle: optional string to include in the title of the resulting plot.
  Used to extend the default title string. If kwargs['title'] is given, it is
  used directly, and the extratitle is ignored

- return_plot_args: boolean defaulting to False. if return_plot_args: we return
  a (data_tuples, plot_options) tuple instead of making the plot. The plot can
  then be made with gp.plot(*data_tuples, **plot_options). Useful if we want to
  include this as a part of a more complex plot

    r'''Visualize the uncertainty in camera projection along one observation ray

SYNOPSIS

    model = mrcal.cameramodel('xxx.cameramodel')

    mrcal.show_projection_uncertainty_vs_distance(model)

    ... A plot pops up displaying the expected projection uncertainty along an
    ... observation ray at different distances from the camera

This function is similar to show_projection_uncertainty(). That function
displays the uncertainty at different locations along the imager, for one
observation distance. Conversely, THIS function displays it in one location on
the imager, but at different distances.

This function uses the expected noise of the calibration-time observations to
estimate the uncertainty of projection of the final model. At calibration time
we estimate

- The intrinsics (lens paramaters) of a number of cameras
- The extrinsics (geometry) of a number of cameras in respect to some reference
  coordinate system
- The poses of observed chessboards, also in respect to some reference
  coordinate system

All the coordinate systems move around, and all 3 of these sets of data have
some uncertainty. This tool takes into account all the uncertainties to report
an estimated uncertainty metric. See
http://mrcal.secretsauce.net/uncertainty.html for a detailed description of
the computation.

The curve produced by this function has a characteristic shape:

- At low ranges, the camera translation dominates, and the uncertainty increases
  to infinity, as the distance to the camera goes to 0

- As we move away from the camera, the uncertainty drops to a minimum, at around
  the distance where the chessboards were observed

- Past the minimum, the uncertainty climbs to asymptotically approach the
  uncertainty at infinity

ARGUMENTS

- model: the mrcal.cameramodel object being evaluated

- where: optional value, defaulting to "centroid". Indicates the point on the
  imager we're examining. May be one of

  - "center": the center of the imager
  - "centroid": the midpoint of all the chessboard corners observed at
    calibration time
  - A numpy array (x,y) indicating the pixel

- isotropic: optional boolean, defaulting to False. We compute the full 2x2
  covariance matrix of the projection. The 1-sigma contour implied by this
  matrix is an ellipse, and we use the worst-case direction by default. If we
  want the RMS size of the ellipse instead of the worst-direction size, pass
  isotropic=True.

- extratitle: optional string to include in the title of the resulting plot.
  Used to extend the default title string. If kwargs['title'] is given, it is
  used directly, and the extratitle is ignored

- return_plot_args: boolean defaulting to False. if return_plot_args: we return
  a (data_tuples, plot_options) tuple instead of making the plot. The plot can
  then be made with gp.plot(*data_tuples, **plot_options). Useful if we want to

    ... A plot pops up displaying how much this model deviates from a pinhole

This function treats a pinhole projection as a baseline, and visualizes
deviations from this baseline. So wide lenses will have a lot of reported

  show_fisheye_projections: the radial plots include the behavior of common
  fisheye projections, in addition to the behavior of THIS lens

- extratitle: optional string to include in the title of the resulting plot.

    r'''Visualize a lens's deviation from a pinhole projection

SYNOPSIS

    model = mrcal.cameramodel('xxx.cameramodel')

    mrcal.show_distortion_off_pinhole( model )

    ... A plot pops up displaying how much this model deviates from a pinhole
    ... model across the imager

This function treats a pinhole projection as a baseline, and visualizes
deviations from this baseline. So wide lenses will have a lot of reported
"distortion".

ARGUMENTS

- model: the mrcal.cameramodel object being evaluated

- vectorfield: optional boolean, defaulting to False. By default we produce a
  heat map of the differences. If vectorfield: we produce a vector field
  instead

- vectorscale: optional value, defaulting to 1.0. Applicable only if
  vectorfield. The magnitude of the errors displayed in the vector field could
  be small, and difficult to see. This argument can be used to scale all the
  displayed vectors to improve legibility.

- cbmax: optional value, defaulting to 25.0. Sets the maximum range of the color
  map and of the contours if plotting a heat map

- gridn_width: how many points along the horizontal gridding dimension

- gridn_height: how many points along the vertical gridding dimension. If None,
  we compute an integer gridn_height to maintain a square-ish grid:
  gridn_height/gridn_width ~ imager_height/imager_width

- extratitle: optional string to include in the title of the resulting plot.
  Used to extend the default title string. If kwargs['title'] is given, it is
  used directly, and the extratitle is ignored

- return_plot_args: boolean defaulting to False. if return_plot_args: we return
  a (data_tuples, plot_options) tuple instead of making the plot. The plot can
  then be made with gp.plot(*data_tuples, **plot_options). Useful if we want to
  include this as a part of a more complex plot

- **kwargs: optional arguments passed verbatim as plot options to gnuplotlib.
  Useful to make hardcopies, etc

RETURNED VALUE

if not return_plot_args (the usual path): we return the gnuplotlib plot object.
The plot disappears when this object is destroyed (by the garbage collection,
for instance), so save this returned plot object into a variable, even if you're
not going to be doing anything with this object.

if return_plot_args: we return a (data_tuples, plot_options) tuple instead of
making the plot. The plot can then be made with gp.plot(*data_tuples,
**plot_options). Useful if we want to include this as a part of a more complex
plot

This function displays the valid-intrinsics region in the given camera models.
Multiple models can be passed-in to see their valid-intrinsics regions together.
This is useful to evaluate different calibrations of the same lens. A captured
image can be passed-in to see the regions overlaid on an actual image produced
by the camera.

All given models MUST have a valid-intrinsics region defined. A model may have
an empty region. This cannot be plotted (there's no contour to plot), but the
plot legend will still contain an entry for this model, with a note indicating
its emptiness

This tool produces a gnuplotlib plot. To annotate an image array, call
annotate_image__valid_intrinsics_region() instead

ARGUMENTS

- models: an iterable of mrcal.cameramodel objects we're visualizing. If we're
  looking at just a single model, it can be passed directly in this argument,
  instead of wrapping it into a list.

- cameranames: optional an iterable of labels, one for each model. These will
  appear as the legend in the plot. If omitted, we will simply enumerate the
  models.

- image: optional image to annotate. May be given as an image filename or an
  array of image data. If omitted, we plot the valid-intrinsics region only.

- points: optional array of shape (N,2) of pixel coordinates to plot. If given,
  we show these arbitrary points in our plot. Useful to visualize the feature
  points used in a vision algorithm to see how reliable they are expected to be

- extratitle: optional string to include in the title of the resulting plot.
  Used to extend the default title string. If kwargs['title'] is given, it is
  used directly, and the extratitle is ignored

- return_plot_args: boolean defaulting to False. if return_plot_args: we return
  a (data_tuples, plot_options) tuple instead of making the plot. The plot can

    r'''Visualize the projection corrections defined by a splined model

SYNOPSIS

    model = mrcal.cameramodel(model_filename)

    mrcal.show_splined_model_correction(model)

    # A plot pops up displaying the spline knots, the magnitude of the
    # corrections defined by the spline surfaces, the spline-in-bounds
    # regions and the valid-intrinsics region

Splined models are parametrized by flexible surfaces that define the projection
corrections (off some baseline model), and visualizing these corrections is
useful for understanding the projection behavior. Details of these models are
described in the documentation:

  http://mrcal.secretsauce.net/lensmodels.html#splined-stereographic-lens-model

At this time LENSMODEL_SPLINED_STEREOGRAPHIC is the only splined model mrcal
has, so the baseline model is always LENSMODEL_STEREOGRAPHIC. In spots, the
below documentation assumes a stereographic baseline model.

This function can produce a plot in the domain either of the input or the output
of the spline functions.

if not imager_domain:
    The default. The plot is presented based on the spline index. With
    LENSMODEL_SPLINED_STEREOGRAPHIC, this is the stereographic projection u.
    This is the "forward" direction, what the projection operation actually
    computes. In this view the knots form a regular grid, and the edge of the
    imager forms a (possibly very irregular) curve

if imager_domain:
    The plot is presented based on the pixels in the imager. This is the
    backward direction: the domain is the OUTPUT of the splined functions. In
    this view the knot layout is (possibly highly) irregular. The edge of the
    imager is a perfect rectangle.

Separate from the domain, the data can be presented in 3 different ways:

- Magnitude heatmap. This is the default. Selected by "not vectorfield and xy is
  None". We plot mag(deltauxy). This displays the deviation from the baseline
  model as a heat map.

- Individual heatmap. Selected by "not vectorfield and xy is not None". We plot
  deltaux or deltauy, depending on the value of xy. This displays the value of
  one of the two splined surfaces individually, as a heat map.

- Vector field. Selected by "bool(vectorfield) is True". Displays the correction
  (deltaux, deltauy) as a vector field.

The splined surfaces are defined by control points we call "knots". These knots
are arranged in a fixed grid (defined by the model configuration) with the value
at each knot set in the intrinsics vector.

The configuration selects the control point density and the expected field of
view of the lens. If the fov_x_deg configuration value is too big, many of the
knots will lie well outside the visible area, and will not be used. This is
wasteful. If fov_x_deg is too small, then some parts of the imager will lie
outside of the spline-in-bounds region, resulting in less-flexible projection
behavior at the edges of the imager. So the field of view should roughly match
the actual lens+camera we're using, and we can evaluate that with this function.
This function displays the spline-in-bounds region together with the usable
projection region (either the valid-intrinsics region or the imager bounds).
Ideally, the spline-in-bounds region is slightly bigger than the usable
projection region.

The usable projection region visualized by this function is controlled by the
valid_intrinsics_region argument. If True (the default), we display the
valid-intrinsics region. This is recommended, but keep in mind that this region
is smaller than the full imager, so a fov_x_deg that aligns well for one
calibration may be too small in a subsequent calibration of the same lens. If
the subsequent calibration has better coverage, and thus a bigger
valid-intrinsics region. If not valid_intrinsics_region: we use the imager
bounds instead. The issue here is that the projection near the edges of the
imager is usually poorly-defined because usually there isn't a lot of
calibration data there. This makes the projection behavior at the imager edges
unknowable. Consequently, plotting the projection at the imager edges is usually
too alarming or not alarming enough. Passing valid_intrinsics_region=False is
thus recommended only if we have very good calibration coverage at the edge of
the imager.

ARGUMENTS

- model: the mrcal.cameramodel object being evaluated

- vectorfield: optional boolean defaults to False. if vectorfield: we plot the
  stereographic correction deltau as vectors. if not vectorfield (the default):
  we plot either deltaux or deltauy or mag(deltauxy) as a heat map. if
  vectorfield: xy must be None

- xy: optional string. Must be either 'x' or 'y' or None. Selects the surface
  we're looking at. We have a separate surface for the x and y coordinates, with
  the two sharing the knot positions. We can display one of the surfaces
  individually, or if xy is None: we display the magnitude of the (deltaux,
  deltauy) vector. if xy is not None: vectorfield MUST be false

- imager_domain: optional boolean defaults to False. If False: we plot
  everything against normalized stereographic coordinates; in this
  representation the knots form a regular grid, and the surface domain is a
  rectangle, but the imager boundary is curved. If True: we plot everything
  against the rendered pixel coordinates; the imager boundary is a rectangle,
  while the knots and domain become curved

- vectorscale: optional value defaulting to 1.0. if vectorfield: this is a scale
  factor on the length of the vectors. If we have small deltau, longer vectors
  increase legibility of the plot.

- valid_intrinsics_region: optional boolean defaults to True. If True: we
  communicate the usable projection region to the user by displaying the
  valid-intrinsics region. This isn't available in all models. To fall back on
  the boundary of the full imager, pass False here. In the usual case of
  incomplete calibration-time coverage at the edges, this results in a very
  unrealistic representation of reality. Passing True here is strongly
  recommended

- observations: optional value, defaulting to False. If observations: we plot
  the calibration-time point observations on top of the surface and the knots.
  These make it more clear if the unprojectable regions in the model really are
  a problem. If a special value of 'dots' is passed, the observations are
  plotted as dots instead of points

- gridn_width: optional value, defaulting to 60. How many points along the
  horizontal gridding dimension

- gridn_height: how many points along the vertical gridding dimension. If None,
  we compute an integer gridn_height to maintain a square-ish grid:
  gridn_height/gridn_width ~ imager_height/imager_width

- extratitle: optional string to include in the title of the resulting plot.
  Used to extend the default title string. If kwargs['title'] is given, it is
  used directly, and the extratitle is ignored

- return_plot_args: boolean defaulting to False. if return_plot_args: we return
  a (data_tuples, plot_options) tuple instead of making the plot. The plot can
  then be made with gp.plot(*data_tuples, **plot_options). Useful if we want to
  include this as a part of a more complex plot

- **kwargs: optional arguments passed verbatim as plot options to gnuplotlib.
  Useful to make hardcopies, etc

RETURNED VALUES

If not return_plot_args (the usual path): we return the gnuplotlib plot object.
The plot disappears when this object is destroyed (by the garbage collection,
for instance), so save this returned plot object into a variable, even if you're
not going to be doing anything with this object.

if return_plot_args: we return a (data_tuples, plot_options) tuple instead of
making the plot. The plot can then be made with gp.plot(*data_tuples,
**plot_options). Useful if we want to include this as a part of a more complex
plot

SYNOPSIS

    model = mrcal.cameramodel('cam0.cameramodel')

    image = mrcal.load_image('image.jpg')

    mrcal.annotate_image__valid_intrinsics_region(image, model)

    mrcal.save_image('image-annotated.jpg', image)

This function reads a valid-intrinsics region from a given camera model, and
draws it on top of a given image. This is useful to see what parts of a captured
image have reliable intrinsics.

This function modifies the input image.

If the given model has no valid-intrinsics region defined, an exception is
thrown. If the valid-intrinsics region is empty, a solid circle is drawn at the
center.

If we want an interactive plot instead of an annotated image, call
mrcal.show_valid_intrinsics_region() instead.

ARGUMENTS

- model: the mrcal.cameramodel object that contains the valid-intrinsics region
  contour

- image: the numpy array containing the image we're annotating. This is both an
  input and an output

- color: optional tuple of length 3 indicating the BGR color of the annotation.
  Green by default

RETURNED VALUES

None. The input image array is modified

We often want to plot some quantity at every location on the imager (intrinsics
uncertainties for instance). This is done by gridding the imager, computing the
quantity at each grid point, and sending this to gnuplot. This involves a few
non-obvious plotting idioms, with the full usage summarized in the above
example.

Due to peculiarities of gnuplot, the 'using' expression produced by this
function can only be used in plots using ascii data commands (i.e. pass
'ascii=True' to gnuplotlib).

ARGUMENTS

- imagersize: a (width,height) tuple for the size of the imager. With a
  mrcal.cameramodel object this is model.imagersize()

- gridn_width: how many points along the horizontal gridding dimension

- gridn_height: how many points along the vertical gridding dimension. If
  omitted or None, we compute an integer gridn_height to maintain a square-ish
  grid: gridn_height/gridn_width ~ imager_height/imager_width

RETURNED VALUE

The 'using' string.

    r'''Visualize calibration residuals for a single observation

SYNOPSIS

    model = mrcal.cameramodel(model_filename)

    mrcal.show_residuals_board_observation( model.optimization_inputs(),
                                            0,
                                            from_worst = True )

    ... A plot pops up showing the worst-fitting chessboard observation from
    ... the calibration run that produced the model in model_filename

Given a calibration solve, visualizes the fit for a single observation. Plots
the chessboard image overlaid with its residuals. Each residual is plotted as a
circle and a vector. The circles are color-coded by the residual error. The size
of the circle indicates the weight. Bigger means higher weight. The vector shows
the weighted residual from the observation to the prediction.

ARGUMENTS

- optimization_inputs: the optimization inputs dict passed into and returned
  from mrcal.optimize(). This describes the solved optimization problem that
  we're visualizing

- i_observation: integer that selects the chessboard observation. If not
  from_worst (the default), this indexes sequential observations, in the order
  in which they appear in the optimization problem. If from_worst: the
  observations are indexed in order from the worst-fitting to the best-fitting:
  i_observation=0 refers to the worst-fitting observation. This is very useful
  to investigate issues in the calibration

- from_worst: optional boolean, defaulting to False. If not from_worst (the
  default), i_observation indexes sequential observations, in the order in which
  they appear in the optimization problem. If from_worst: the observations are
  indexed in order from the worst-fitting to the best-fitting: i_observation=0
  refers to the worst-fitting observation. This is very useful to investigate
  issues in the calibration

- i_observations_sorted_from_worst: optional iterable of integers used to
  convert sorted-from-worst observation indices to as-specified observation
  indices. If omitted or None, this will be recomputed. To use a cached value,
  pass in a precomputed value. See the sources for an example of how to compute
  it

- residuals: optional numpy array of shape (Nmeasurements,) containing the
  optimization residuals. If omitted or None, this will be recomputed. To use a
  cached value, pass the result of mrcal.optimize(**optimization_inputs)['x'] or
  mrcal.optimizer_callback(**optimization_inputs)[1]

- paths: optional iterable of strings, containing image filenames corresponding
  to each observation. If omitted or None or if the image couldn't be found, the
  residuals will be plotted without the source image. The path we search is
  controlled by the image_path_prefix and image_directory options

- image_path_prefix: optional argument, defaulting to None, exclusive with
  "image_directory". If given, the image paths in the "paths" argument are
  prefixed with the given string.

- image_directory: optional argument, defaulting to None, exclusive with
  "image_path_prefix". If given, we extract the filename from the image path in
  the "paths" argument, and look for the images in the directory given here
  instead

- circlescale: optional scale factor to adjust the size of the plotted circles.
  If omitted, a unit scale (1.0) is used. This exists to improve the legibility
  of the generated plot

- vectorscale: optional scale factor to adjust the length of the plotted
  vectors. If omitted, a unit scale (1.0) is used: this results in the vectors
  representing pixel errors directly. This exists to improve the legibility of
  the generated plot

- showimage: optional boolean, defaulting to True. If False, we do NOT plot the
  image beneath the residuals.

- extratitle: optional string to include in the title of the resulting plot.
  Used to extend the default title string. If kwargs['title'] is given, it is
  used directly, and the extratitle is ignored

- return_plot_args: boolean defaulting to False. if return_plot_args: we return
  a (data_tuples, plot_options) tuple instead of making the plot. The plot can
  then be made with gp.plot(*data_tuples, **plot_options). Useful if we want to
  include this as a part of a more complex plot

- **kwargs: optional arguments passed verbatim as plot options to gnuplotlib.
  Useful to make hardcopies, etc

RETURNED VALUES

if not return_plot_args (the usual path): we return the gnuplotlib plot object.
The plot disappears when this object is destroyed (by the garbage collection,
for instance), so save this returned plot object into a variable, even if you're
not going to be doing anything with this object.

If return_plot_args: we return a (data_tuples, plot_options) tuple instead of
making the plot. The plot can then be made with gp.plot(*data_tuples,
**plot_options). Useful if we want to include this as a part of a more complex
plot

    r'''Visualize the optimized residuals as a vector field

SYNOPSIS

    model = mrcal.cameramodel(model_filename)

    mrcal.show_residuals_vectorfield( model )

    ... A plot pops up showing each observation from this camera used to
    ... compute this calibration as a vector field. Each vector shows the
    ... observed and predicted location of each chessboard corner

Given a calibration solve, visualizes the errors at the optimal solution as a
vector field. Each vector runs from the observed chessboard corner to its
prediction at the optimal solution.

ARGUMENTS

- model: the mrcal.cameramodel object representing the camera model we're
  investigating. This cameramodel MUST contain the optimization_inputs data

- residuals: optional numpy array of shape (Nmeasurements,) containing the
  optimization residuals. If omitted or None, this will be recomputed. To use a
  cached value, pass the result of mrcal.optimize(**optimization_inputs)['x'] or
  mrcal.optimizer_callback(**optimization_inputs)[1]

- vectorscale: optional scale factor to adjust the length of the plotted
  vectors. If omitted, a unit scale (1.0) is used. Any other scale factor makes
  the tip of each vector run past (or short) of the predicted corner position.
  This exists to improve the legibility of the generated plot

- valid_intrinsics_region: optional boolean, defaulting to True. If
  valid_intrinsics_region: the valid-intrinsics region present in the model is
  shown in the plot. This is usually interesting to compare to the set of
  observations plotted by the rest of this function

- extratitle: optional string to include in the title of the resulting plot.
  Used to extend the default title string. If kwargs['title'] is given, it is
  used directly, and the extratitle is ignored

- return_plot_args: boolean defaulting to False. if return_plot_args: we return
  a (data_tuples, plot_options) tuple instead of making the plot. The plot can
  then be made with gp.plot(*data_tuples, **plot_options). Useful if we want to
  include this as a part of a more complex plot

- **kwargs: optional arguments passed verbatim as plot options to gnuplotlib.
  Useful to make hardcopies, etc

RETURNED VALUES

if not return_plot_args (the usual path): we return the gnuplotlib plot object.
The plot disappears when this object is destroyed (by the garbage collection,
for instance), so save this returned plot object into a variable, even if you're
not going to be doing anything with this object.

SYNOPSIS

    model = mrcal.cameramodel(model_filename)

    mrcal.show_residuals_regional( model )

    ... Three plots pop up, showing the mean, standard deviation and the count
    ... of residuals in each region in the imager

This serves as a simple method of estimating calibration reliability, without
computing the projection uncertainty.

The imager of a camera is subdivided into bins (controlled by the gridn_width,
gridn_height arguments). The residual statistics are then computed for each bin
separately. We can then clearly see areas of insufficient data (observation
counts will be low). And we can clearly see lens-model-induced biases (non-zero
mean) and we can see heteroscedasticity (uneven standard deviation). The
mrcal-calibrate-cameras tool uses these metrics to construct a valid-intrinsics
region for the models it computes. This serves as a quick/dirty method of
modeling projection reliability, which can be used even if projection
uncertainty cannot be computed.

ARGUMENTS

  investigating. This cameramodel MUST contain the optimization_inputs data

- gridn_width: optional value, defaulting to 20. How many bins along the
  horizontal gridding dimension

- gridn_height: how many bins along the vertical gridding dimension. If None, we
  compute an integer gridn_height to maintain a square-ish grid:
  gridn_height/gridn_width ~ imager_height/imager_width

- residuals: optional numpy array of shape (Nmeasurements,) containing the
  optimization residuals. If omitted or None, this will be recomputed. To use a
  cached value, pass the result of mrcal.optimize(**optimization_inputs)['x'] or
  mrcal.optimizer_callback(**optimization_inputs)[1]

- valid_intrinsics_region: optional boolean, defaulting to True. If
  valid_intrinsics_region: the valid-intrinsics region present in the model is
  shown in the plot. This is usually interesting to compare to the set of
  observations plotted by the rest of this function

  Used to extend the default title string. If kwargs['title'] is given, it is

  a (data_tuples, plot_options) tuple instead of making the plot. The plot can
  then be made with gp.plot(*data_tuples, **plot_options). Useful if we want to
  include this as a part of a more complex plot

- **kwargs: optional arguments passed verbatim as plot options to gnuplotlib.
  Useful to make hardcopies, etc. A "hardcopy" here is a base name:
  kwargs['hardcopy']="/a/b/c/d.pdf" will produce plots in "/a/b/c/d.XXX.pdf"

    r'''Color-code an array

SYNOPSIS

    image = produce_data()

    print( image.shape )
    ===>
    (480, 640)

    image_colorcoded = mrcal.apply_color_map(image)

    print( image_colorcoded.shape )
    ===>
    (480, 640, 3)

    print( image_colorcoded.dtype )
    ===>
    dtype('uint8')

    mrcal.save_image('data.png', image_colorcoded)

This is very similar to cv2.applyColorMap() but more flexible in several
important ways. Differences:

- Supports arrays of any shape. Most of the time the input is 2-dimensional
  images, but this isn't required

- Supports any input data type, NOT limited to 8-bit images like
  cv2.applyColorMap()

- Does not support MATLAB color maps. At this time only one color map is
  supported (the default Gnuplot color map). Other gnuplot color maps will be
  supported in the future.

The color map is applied to each value in the input, each one producing an BGR
row of shape (3,). So output.shape is input.shape + (3,).

The output has dtype=numpy.uint8, so these arrays can be output as images, and
visualized using any image-viewing tools.

At this time only one color map is supported: the default color map used by
gnuplot. Support for others will be added in the future.

ARGUMENTS

- array: input numpy array

- a_min: optional value indicating the lower bound of the values we color map.
  All input values outside of the range [a_min,a_max] are clipped. If omitted, I
  use array.min()

- a_max: optional value indicating the upper bound of the values we color map.
  All input values outside of the range [a_min,a_max] are clipped. If omitted, I
  use array.max()

RETURNED VALUE

The color-mapped output array of shape array.shape + (3,) and containing 8-bit
unsigned integers. The last row is the BGR color-mapped values.
