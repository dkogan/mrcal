'''Routines to manipulate poses, transformations and points

Most of these are Python wrappers around the written-in-C Python extension
module mrcal._poseutils_npsp. Most of the time you want to use this module
instead of touching mrcal._poseutils_npsp directly.

All functions are exported into the mrcal module. So you can call these via
mrcal.poseutils.fff() or mrcal.fff(). The latter is preferred.

def r_from_R(R, *, get_gradients=False, out=None):
    r"""Compute a Rodrigues vector from a rotation matrix

SYNOPSIS

    r = mrcal.r_from_R(R)

    rotation_magnitude = nps.mag(r)
    rotation_axis      = r / rotation_magnitude

Given a rotation specified as a (3,3) rotation matrix, converts it to a
Rodrigues vector, a unit rotation axis scaled by the rotation magnitude, in
radians.

By default this function returns the Rodrigues vector(s) only. If we also want
gradients, pass get_gradients=True. Logic:

    if not get_gradients: return r
    else:                 return (r, dr/dR)

This function supports broadcasting fully.

Note that the rotation r is not unique: the rotation angle (the magnitude of r)
is only unique modulo 2 pi. And even then, rotations around axis v with angle
pi+th are equivalent to rotations around axis -v with angle pi-th. So usually we
will return r with mag(r) in [0,pi]. If the rotation angle is near pi, the
returned r might have a magnitude slightly larger than pi.

Furthermore, the gradient dr/dR needs a note. R is a (3,3) matrix, but not all
(3,3) matrices are valid rotations. Let's define vecR as a flattened (9,) vector
of all the values in R. The local linearization

  delta_r = dr/dvecR delta_vecR

is only meaningful if delta_vecR is in the valid-rotation subspace. Thus the
gradient returned by this function is any dr/dvecR + K where K maps
out-of-valid-R directions to 0. The matrix returned by this function CANNOT be
assumed to have K = 0.

ARGUMENTS

- R: array of shape (3,3). This matrix defines the rotation. It is assumed that
  this is a valid rotation (matmult(R,transpose(R)) = I, det(R) = 1), but that
  is not checked

- get_gradients: optional boolean. By default (get_gradients=False) we return an
  array of Rodrigues vectors. Otherwise we return a tuple of arrays of Rodrigues
  vectors and their gradients.

- out: optional argument specifying the destination. By default, new numpy
  array(s) are created and returned. To write the results into existing (and
  possibly non-contiguous) arrays, specify them with the 'out' kwarg. If not
  get_gradients: 'out' is the one numpy array we will write into. Else: 'out' is
  a tuple of all the output numpy arrays. If 'out' is given, we return the 'out'
  that was passed in. This is the standard behavior provided by
  numpysane_pywrap.

RETURNED VALUE

If not get_gradients: we return an array of Rodrigues vector(s). Each
broadcasted slice has shape (3,)

If get_gradients: we return a tuple of arrays containing the Rodrigues vector(s)
and the gradients (r, dr/dR)

1. The Rodrigues vector. Each broadcasted slice has shape (3,)

2. The gradient dr/dR. Each broadcasted slice has shape (3,3,3). The first
   dimension selects the element of r, and the last two dimensions select the
   element of R

Note that the rotation r is not unique: the rotation angle (the magnitude of r)
is only unique modulo 2 pi. And even then, rotations around axis v with angle
pi+th are equivalent to rotations around axis -v with angle pi-th. So usually we

Given 2 or more rt transformations, returns their composition. An rt
transformation is a (6,) array formed by nps.glue(r,t, axis=-1) where r is a
(3,) Rodrigues vector and t is a (3,) translation vector. This transformation is
defined by a matrix multiplication and an addition. x and t are stored as a row
vector (that's how numpy stores 1-dimensional arrays), but the multiplication
works as if x was a column vector (to match linear algebra conventions):

    transform_point_rt(rt, x) = transpose( matmult(R_from_r(rt[:3]), transpose(x)) +
                                           transpose(rt[3,:]) ) =
                              = matmult(x, transpose(R_from_r(rt[:3]))) +
                                rt[3:]

By default this function returns the composed transformation only. If we also
want gradients, pass get_gradients=True. This is supported ONLY if we have
EXACTLY 2 transformations to compose. Logic:

    if not get_gradients: return rt=compose(rt0,rt1)
    else:                 return (rt=compose(rt0,rt1), dr/drt0, dr/drt1)

Note that the poseutils C API returns only

- dr_dr0
- dr_dr1
- dt_dr0
- dt_dt1

because

- dr/dt0 is always 0
- dr/dt1 is always 0
- dt/dr1 is always 0
- dt/dt0 is always the identity matrix

This Python function, however fills in those constants to return the full (and
more convenient) arrays.

This function supports broadcasting fully, so we can compose lots of
transformations at the same time.

In-place operation is supported; the output array may be the same as either of
the input arrays to overwrite the input.

Some details about the returned r are described in the documentation for
compose_r()

ARGUMENTS

- *rt: a list of transformations to compose. Usually we'll be composing two
  transformations, but any number could be given here. Each broadcasted slice
  has shape (6,)

- get_gradients: optional boolean. By default (get_gradients=False) we return an
  array of composed transformations. Otherwise we return a tuple of arrays of
  composed transformations and their gradients. Gradient reporting is only
  supported when exactly two transformations are given

- out: optional argument specifying the destination. By default, new numpy
  array(s) are created and returned. To write the results into existing (and
  possibly non-contiguous) arrays, specify them with the 'out' kwarg. If not
  get_gradients: 'out' is the one numpy array we will write into. Else: 'out' is
  a tuple of all the output numpy arrays. If 'out' is given, we return the 'out'
  that was passed in. This is the standard behavior provided by
  numpysane_pywrap.

RETURNED VALUE

broadcasted slice has shape (6,)

If get_gradients: we return a tuple of arrays containing the composed
transformations and the gradients (rt=compose(rt0,rt1),

1. The composed transformation. Each broadcasted slice has shape (6,)

2. The gradient drt/dr0. Each broadcasted slice has shape (6,6). The first
   dimension selects the element of rt, and the last dimension selects the
   element of rt0

3. The gradient drt/drt1. Each broadcasted slice has shape (6,6). The first
   dimension selects the element of rt, and the last dimension selects the
   element of rt1

Transform point(s) by an rt transformation: a (6,) array formed by
nps.glue(r,t, axis=-1) where r is a (3,) Rodrigues vector and t is a (3,)
translation vector. This transformation is defined by a matrix multiplication
and an addition. x and t are stored as a row vector (that's how numpy stores
1-dimensional arrays), but the multiplication works as if x was a column vector
(to match linear algebra conventions):

    transform_point_rt(rt, x) = transpose( matmult(R_from_r(rt[:3]), transpose(x)) +
                                           transpose(rt[3,:]) ) =
                              = matmult(x, transpose(R_from_r(rt[:3]))) +
                                rt[3:]

By default this function returns the transformed points only. If we also want
gradients, pass get_gradients=True. Logic:

    if not get_gradients: return u=rt(x)
    else:                 return (u=rt(x),du/drt,du/dx)

This function supports broadcasting fully, so we can transform lots of points at
the same time and/or apply lots of different transformations at the same time

In-place operation is supported; the output array may be the same as the input
arrays to overwrite the input.

ARGUMENTS

- rt: array of shape (6,). This vector defines the transformation. rt[:3] is a
  rotation defined as a Rodrigues vector; rt[3:] is a translation.

- x: array of shape (3,). The point being transformed

- get_gradients: optional boolean. By default (get_gradients=False) we return an
  array of transformed points. Otherwise we return a tuple of arrays of
  transformed points and their gradients.

- inverted: optional boolean, defaulting to False. If True, the opposite
  transformation is computed. The gradient du/drt is returned in respect to the
  input rt

- out: optional argument specifying the destination. By default, new numpy
  array(s) are created and returned. To write the results into existing (and
  possibly non-contiguous) arrays, specify them with the 'out' kwarg. If not
  get_gradients: 'out' is the one numpy array we will write into. Else: 'out' is
  a tuple of all the output numpy arrays. If 'out' is given, we return the 'out'
  that was passed in. This is the standard behavior provided by
  numpysane_pywrap.

RETURNED VALUE

Converts an Rt transformation to a qt transformation. Both specify a rotation
and translation. An Rt transformation is a (4,3) array formed by nps.glue(R,t,
axis=-2) where R is a (3,3) rotation matrix and t is a (3,) translation vector.
A qt transformation is a (7,) array formed by nps.glue(q,t, axis=-1) where q is
a (4,) unit quaternion and t is a (3,) translation vector.

Applied to a point x the transformed result is rotate(x)+t. Given a matrix R,
the rotation is defined by a matrix multiplication. x and t are stored as a row
vector (that's how numpy stores 1-dimensional arrays), but the multiplication
works as if x was a column vector (to match linear algebra conventions). See the
docs for mrcal._transform_point_Rt() for more detail.

This function supports broadcasting fully.

Note: mrcal does not use unit quaternions anywhere to represent rotations. This
function is provided for convenience, but isn't thoroughly tested.
