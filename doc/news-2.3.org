#+TITLE: mrcal 2.3 release notes
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* New in mrcal 2.3
residuals_chessboard() argument rename: i_cam -> icam_intrinsics
For consistency. Old argument still accepted for compatibility

residuals_chessboard() has new return_observations argument
The default return_observations=False produces the original behavior. if
return_observations: we return residuals,observations

added residuals_point()

show_residuals_....() displays board AND point residuals

mrcal_image_..._crop() is now static inline
This fixes linker errors on some compilers

Commandline tools print errors instead of throwing exceptions

mrcal-stereo writes out a binary disparity image for easy post-processing

show_projection_diff() and mrcal-show-projection-diff handles nan values better:
no confused plots or ugly warnings on the console

mrcal.rectified_resolution() is now separate from mrcal.rectified_system(), and
has a callable C implementation

same with mrcal.rectified_system(), rectification_maps

estimate_monocular_calobject_poses_Rt_tocam() ignores invalid input points
This makes calibrating given incomplete chessboard observations work properly

show_projection_diff() can plot vectorfields with multiple distances
And the mrcal-show-projections-diff tool. Same as with heat maps, we plot the
diff for the first distance

mrcal.optimize(), mrcal.optimizer_callback(): all arguments are keyword-only,
most arguments are optional

measurement_index_....() all return <0 if those measurements aren't present

save_image() can write 16bpp grayscale images properly
This requires a more recent libfreeimage than is available on some OSs

mrcal-stereo respects --axis-scale
Not doing this was an oversight

full CAHVORE support

show_residuals_board_observation() reports iobservation_from_worst in its title
Applies to the mrcal-show-residuals-board-observation tool as well. Makes it
simple to regenerate specific plots, even if they were displayed out of order

mrcal-show-residuals-board-observation has --from-glob

Added mrcal.make_perfect_observations()

bug fix: mrcal-stereo can process multiple files with one invocation again

mrcal-stereo can rectify images in parallel

* Migration notes 2.2 -> 2.3
