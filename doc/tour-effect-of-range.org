* The effect of range in differencing and uncertainty computations
Earlier I talked about model [[file:tour-differencing.org][differencing]] and estimation of [[file:tour-uncertainty.org][projection
uncertainty]]. In both cases I glossed over one important detail that I would like
to revisit now. A refresher:

- To compute a diff, I unproject $\vec q_0$ to a point in space $\vec p$ (in
  camera coordinates), transform it, and project that back to the other camera
  to get $\vec q_1$

- To compute an uncertainty, I unproject $\vec q_0$ to (eventually) a point in
  space $\vec p_\mathrm{fixed}$ (in some fixed coordinate system), then project
  it back, propagating all the uncertainties of all the quantities used to
  compute the transformations and projection.

The significant part is the specifics of "unproject $\vec q_0$". Unlike a
projection operation, an /unprojection/ is ambiguous: given some
camera-coordinate-system point $\vec p$ that projects to a pixel $\vec q$, we
have $\vec q = \mathrm{project}\left(k \vec v\right)$ /for all/ $k$. So an
unprojection gives you a direction, but no range. What that means in this case,
is that we must choose a range of interest when computing diffs or
uncertainties. It only makes sense to talk about a "diff when looking at points
$r$ meters away" or "the projection uncertainty when looking out to $r$ meters".

A surprising consequence of this is that while /projection/ is invariant to
scaling ($k \vec v$ projects to the same $\vec q$ for all $k$), the uncertainty
of this projection is /not/:

Let's look at the projection uncertainty at the center of the imager at
different ranges for the =LENSMODEL_OPENCV8= model we computed earlier:

So the uncertainty grows without bound as we approach the camera. As we move
away, there's a sweet spot where we have maximum confidence. And as we move
further out still, we approach some uncertainty asymptote at infinity.
Qualitatively this is the figure I see 100% of the time, with the position of
the minimum and of the asymptote varying.

Why is the uncertainty unbounded as we approach the camera? Because we're
looking at the projection of a fixed point into a camera whose position is
uncertain. As we get closer to the origin of the camera, the noise in the camera
position dominates the projection, and the uncertainty shoots to infinity.

What controls the range where we see the lowest uncertainty? The range where we
observed the chessboards. I will prove this conclusively in the next section. It
makes sense: the lowest uncertainty corresponds to the region where we have the
most information.

What controls the uncertainty at infinity? The empirical studies in the [[file:tour-choreography.org][next
section]] answer that conclusively.

This is a very important effect to characterize. In many applications the
distance of observations at calibration time varies significantly from the
working distance post-calibration. For instance, any application involving wide
lenses will use closeup calibration images, but working images from much further
out. We don't want to compute a calibration where the calibration-range
uncertainty is great, but the working-range uncertainty is poor.

I should emphasize that while unintuitive, this uncertainty-depends-on-range
effect is very real. It isn't just something that you get out of some opaque
equations, but it's observable in the field. We can't see it in [[file:tour-cross-validation.org][the cross
validation diffs we just computed]] because the noncentral model errors
dominate, but if we throw out all the observations away from the center, the
noncentral errors disappear, and the effect is clearly seen empirically.

I threw out all points outside of a circle in the center with radius 1500 pixels
(using the [[file:mrcal-cull-corners.html][=mrcal-cull-corners=]] tool). Cross-validation diff at 1m (chessboards
are here; we expect this to be low):

[[file:external/figures/cross-validation/diff-culled-at-1m.png]]

And at infinity (uncertainty plot tells us that this should be worse):

[[file:external/figures/cross-validation/diff-culled-at-infinity.png]]

Clearly the prediction that uncertainties are lowest at the chessboard distance,
and increase as we move away is borne out here by just looking at diffs,
/without/ computing the uncertainty curves. This effect is universal, and is
especially clear when the uncertainties at the chessboard distance and at
infinity are very different. How do we make sure that the uncertainty at
infinity is still low, despite the fact that no chessboards were observed there?
Read on.
