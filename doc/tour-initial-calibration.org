* Gathering chessboard corners
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: gathering-corners
:END:

We start by gathering images of a [[file:formulation.org::#calibration-object][chessboard]]. This is a wide lens, so I need a
large chessboard in order to fill the imager. My chessboard has 10x10 internal
corners with a corner-corner spacing of 7.7cm. A big chessboard such as this is
never completely rigid or completely flat. I'm using a board backed with 2cm of
foam, which keeps the shape stable over short periods of time, long-enough to
complete a board dance. But the shape still drifts with changes in temperature
and humidity, so mrcal estimates the [[file:formulation.org::#board-deformation][board shape]] as part of its calibration
solve.

An important consideration when gathering calibration images is keeping them in
focus. As we shall see [[file:tour-choreography.org][later]], we want to gather close-up images as much as
possible, so depth-of-field is the limiting factor. Moving the focus ring or the
aperture ring on the lens /may/ affect the intrinsics, so ideally a single lens
setting can cover both the calibration-time closeups and the working distance
(presumably much further out).

So for these tests I set the focus to infinity, and gather all my images at F22
to increase the depth-of-field as much as I can. To also avoid motion blur I
need fast exposures, so I did all the image gathering outside, with bright
natural lighting.

The images live [[file:external/data/board][here]]. I'm using [[https://github.com/dkogan/mrgingham/][mrgingham]] 1.19 to detect the [[file:external/data/board/corners.vnl][chessboard corners]]:

#+begin_src sh
mrgingham -j3 '*.JPG' > corners.vnl 
#+end_src

How well did we cover the imager? Did we get the edges and corners?

#+begin_example
$ < corners.vnl       \
  vnl-filter -p x,y | \
  feedgnuplot --domain --square --set 'xrange [0:6016]' --set 'yrange [4016:0]'
#+end_example
#+begin_src sh :exports none :eval no-export

    --hardcopy ~/projects/mrcal-doc-external/figures/calibration/mrgingham-coverage.png
#+end_src

[[file:external/figures/calibration/mrgingham-coverage.png]]

Looks like we did OK. It's a bit thin along the bottom edge, but not terrible.
For an arbitrary image we can visualize at the corner detections:

#+begin_example
$ < corners.vnl head -n5

    "filename eq \"${f:t}\""     \
    -p x,y,size='2**(1-level)' | \

    --terminal 'pngcairo size 1024,768 transparent noenhanced crop          font ",12"'
#+end_src

[[file:external/figures/calibration/mrgingham-results.png]]

So in this image many of the corners were detected at full-resolution (level-0),
but some required downsampling for the detector to find them. This is indicated
by smaller circles. The downsampled points have less precision, so they are
[[file:formulation.org::#noise-in-measurement-vector][weighed less in the optimization]]. How many images produced successful corner
detections?

#+begin_example
$ < corners.vnl vnl-filter --has x -p filename | uniq | grep -v '#' | wc -l

161


$ < corners.vnl vnl-filter x=='"-"' -p filename | uniq | grep -v '#' | wc -l

114
#+end_example

So we have 161 images with detected corners, and 114 images where a full
chessboard wasn't found. Most of the misses are probably images where the
chessboard wasn't entirely in view, but some could be failures of mrgingham. In
any case, 161 observations is usually plenty.

If I had more that one camera, the image filenames would need to indicate what
camera captured each image at which time. I generally use
=frameFFF-cameraCCC.jpg=. Images with the same =FFF= are assumed to have been
captured at the same instant in time.

* Monocular calibration with the 8-parameter opencv model
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: opencv8-model-solving
:END:

Let's calibrate the intrinsics! We begin with [[file:lensmodels.org::#lensmodel-opencv][=LENSMODEL_OPENCV8=]], a lean model
that supports wide lenses decently well. Primarily it does this with a rational
radial "distortion" model. Projecting $\vec p$ in the camera coordinate system:

\begin{aligned}
\vec P &\equiv \frac{\vec p_{xy}}{p_z} \\
r &\equiv \left|\vec P\right|            \\
\vec P_\mathrm{radial} &\equiv \frac{ 1 + k_0 r^2 + k_1 r^4 + k_4 r^6}{ 1 + k_5 r^2 + k_6 r^4 + k_7 r^6} \vec P \\
\vec q &= \vec f_{xy} \left( \vec P_\mathrm{radial} + \cdots \right) + \vec c_{xy}
\end{aligned}

Where $\vec q$ is the resulting projected pixel, $\vec f_{xy}$
is the focal lengths and $\vec c_{xy}$ is the center pixel of the imager.

Let's compute the calibration using the [[file:mrcal-calibrate-cameras.html][=mrcal-calibrate-cameras=]] tool:

#+begin_src sh
mrcal-calibrate-cameras         \
  --corners-cache corners.vnl   \
  --lensmodel LENSMODEL_OPENCV8 \
  --focal 1700                  \
  --object-spacing 0.077        \
  --object-width-n 10           \
  '*.JPG'
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh :exports none :eval no-export
D=~/projects/mrcal-doc-external
~/projects/mrcal/mrcal-calibrate-cameras    \
  --corners-cache $D/data/board/corners.vnl \
  --lensmodel LENSMODEL_OPENCV8             \
  --focal 1700                              \
  --object-spacing 0.077                    \
  --object-width-n 10                       \
  '*.JPG'
#+end_src

I'm specifying the initial very rough estimate of the focal length (in pixels),
the geometry of my chessboard (10x10 board with 0.077m spacing between corners),
the lens model I want to use, chessboard corners we just detected, the estimated
uncertainty of the corner detections (more on this later) and the image globs. I
have just one camera, so I have one glob: =*.JPG=. With more cameras you'd have
something like ='*-camera0.jpg' '*-camera1.jpg' '*-camera2.jpg'=.

We could pass =--explore= to drop into a REPL after the computation is done, so
that we can look around. The most common diagnostic images can be made by
running the [[file:commandline-tools.org][=mrcal-show-...= commandline tools]] on the generated
=xxx.cameramodel= files, but =--explore= can be useful to get more sophisticated
feedback.

The [[file:mrcal-calibrate-cameras.html][=mrcal-calibrate-cameras=]] tool reports some high-level diagnostics, writes
the output model(s) to disk, and exits:

#+begin_example

calobject_warp = [-0.00104306  0.00051718]

Wrote ./camera-0.cameramodel
#+end_example

The resulting model is renamed to =opencv8.cameramodel=, and is available [[file:external/data/board/opencv8.cameramodel][here]].
This is a [[file:cameramodels.org][mrcal-native =.cameramodel= file]] containing at least the lens
parameters and the geometry.

Let's sanity-check the results. We want to flag down any issues with the data
that would violate the [[file:formulation.org::#noise-model][assumptions made by the solver]].

The tool reports some diagnostics. As we can see, the final RMS reprojection
error was 0.7 pixels. Of the 16100 corner observations (161 observations of the
board with 10*10 = 100 points each), 155 didn't fit the model well-enough, and
were thrown out as [[file:formulation.org::#outlier-rejection][outliers]]. And the [[file:formulation.org::#board-deformation][board flex]] was computed as 1.0mm
horizontally, and 0.5mm vertically in the opposite direction. That all sounds
reasonable.

What does the solve think about our geometry? Does it match reality?

#+end_src

[[file:external/figures/calibration/calibration-chessboards-geometry.svg]]

Here we see the [[file:formulation.org::#world-geometry][axes of our camera]] (purple) situated at the [[file:formulation.org::#world-geometry][reference coordinate
system]]. In this solve, the camera coordinate system /is/ the reference
coordinate system; this would look more interesting with more cameras. In front
of the camera (along the $z$ axis) we can see the solved chessboard poses. There
are a whole lot of them, and they're all sitting right in front of the camera
with some heavy tilt. This matches with how this chessboard dance was performed
(by following the guidelines set by the [[file:tour-choreography.org][dance study]]).

Next, let's examine the residuals more closely. We have an overall RMS
reprojection error value from above, but let's look at the full distribution of
errors for /all/ the cameras:

#+begin_src sh
mrcal-show-residuals    \
  --histogram           \
  --set 'xrange [-4:4]' \
  --unset key           \

  opencv8.cameramodel
#+end_src

  --binwidth 0.1 \
  --hardcopy "$D/figures/calibration/residuals-histogram-opencv8.svg" \
  --terminal 'svg size 800,600 noenhanced solid dynamic font ",14"' \
  $D/data/board/opencv8.cameramodel

D=~/projects/mrcal-doc-external
PYTHONPATH=/home/dima/projects/mrcal ~/projects/mrcal/mrcal-show-residuals \
  --histogram  \
  --set 'xrange [-4:4]' \
  --unset key           \
  --binwidth 0.1 \
  --hardcopy "$D/figures/calibration/residuals-histogram-opencv8.pdf" \
  --terminal 'pdf size 8in,6in noenhanced solid color   font ",12"' \
  $D/data/board/opencv8.cameramodel
#+end_src

[[file:external/figures/calibration/residuals-histogram-opencv8.svg]]

We would like to see a normal distribution since that's what the [[file:formulation.org::#noise-model][noise model]]
assumes. We do see this somewhat, but the central cluster is a bit
over-populated. This is a violation of the noise model, but at this time I don't
have a good sense of what this means. It's normal-ish, and there isn't a lot to
do about this, so I will claim this is close-enough.

Let's look deeper. If there's anything really wrong with our data, then we
should see it in the worst-fitting images. Let's ask the tool to see the worst
one:

#+begin_src sh
mrcal-show-residuals-board-observation \
  --from-worst                         \
  --vectorscale 100                    \
  --circlescale 0.5                    \
  --set 'cbrange [0:3]'                \
  opencv8.cameramodel                  \
  0
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh :exports none :eval no-export
D=~/projects/mrcal-doc-external
PYTHONPATH=/home/dima/projects/mrcal ~/projects/mrcal/mrcal-show-residuals-board-observation \
  --from-worst \
  --vectorscale 100 \
  --circlescale 0.5 \
  --set 'cbrange [0:3]' \
  --hardcopy "$D/figures/calibration/worst-opencv8.png" \
  --terminal 'pngcairo size 1024,768 transparent noenhanced crop          font ",12"' \
  $D/data/board/opencv8.cameramodel \
  0
#+end_src

[[file:external/figures/calibration/worst-opencv8.png]]

The residual vector for each chessboard corner in this observation is shown,
scaled by a factor of 100 for legibility (the actual errors are tiny!) The
circle color also indicates the magnitude of the errors. The size of each circle
represents the weight given to that point. The weight is reduced for points that
were detected at a lower resolution by the chessboard detector. Points thrown
out as outliers are not shown at all.

Residual plots such as this one are a good way to identify common data-gathering
issues such as:

- out-of focus images
- images with motion blur
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_shutter][rolling shutter]] effects
- synchronization errors
- chessboard detector failures
- insufficiently-rich models (of the lens or of the chessboard shape or anything
  else)

Back to /this/ image. In absolute terms, even this worst-fitting image fits
/really/ well. The RMS error of the errors in this image is 1.20 pixels. The
residuals in this image look mostly reasonable. There is a pattern, however: the
errors are mostly radial (point to/from the center). This could cause biases
later on. Let's keep going, keeping this in mind as something we should address
later.

One issue with lean models such as =LENSMODEL_OPENCV8=, which is used here, is
that the radial distortion is never quite right, especially as we move further
and further away form the optical axis: this is the last point in the
common-errors list above. We can clearly see this here in the 3rd-worst image:

#+begin_src sh
mrcal-show-residuals-board-observation \
  --from-worst                         \
  --vectorscale 100                    \
  --circlescale 0.5                    \
  --set 'cbrange [0:3]'                \
  opencv8.cameramodel                  \
  2
#+end_src

  $D/data/board/opencv8.cameramodel \
  2
#+end_src

[[file:external/figures/calibration/worst-incorner-opencv8.png]]

/This/ is clearly a problem. We note that this is observation 79, so that we can
come back to it later.

Let's look at the systematic errors in another way: let's look at all the
residuals over all the observations, color-coded by their direction, ignoring
the magnitudes:

#+begin_src sh
mrcal-show-residuals    \
  --directions          \
  --unset key           \
  opencv8.cameramodel
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh :exports none :eval no-export
D=~/projects/mrcal-doc-external
PYTHONPATH=/home/dima/projects/mrcal ~/projects/mrcal/mrcal-show-residuals \
  --directions \
  --unset key           \
  --set 'pointsize 0.5' \
  --hardcopy "$D/figures/calibration/directions-opencv8.svg" \
  --terminal 'svg size 800,600 noenhanced solid dynamic font ",14"' \
  $D/data/board/opencv8.cameramodel

D=~/projects/mrcal-doc-external
PYTHONPATH=/home/dima/projects/mrcal ~/projects/mrcal/mrcal-show-residuals \
  --directions \
  --unset key           \
  --set 'pointsize 0.25' \
  --hardcopy "$D/figures/calibration/directions-opencv8.pdf" \
  --terminal 'pdf size 8in,6in noenhanced solid color   font ",12"' \
  $D/data/board/opencv8.cameramodel
#+end_src

[[file:external/figures/calibration/directions-opencv8.png]]

As before, if the model fit the observations, the errors would represent random
noise, and no color pattern would be discernible in these dots. Here we can
clearly see lots of green in the top-right and top and left, lots of blue and
magenta in the center, yellow at the bottom, and so on. This is not random
noise, and is a /very/ clear indication that this lens model is not able to fit
this data.

It would be good to have a quantitative measure of these systematic patterns. At
this time mrcal doesn't provide an automated way to do that. This will be added
in the future.

Clearly there're unmodeled errors in this solve. As we have seen, the errors
here are all fairly small, but they become very important when doing precision
work like, for instance, long-range stereo.

Let's fix it.

* Monocular calibration with a splined stereographic model
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: splined-stereographic-fit
:END:

Usable [[file:uncertainty.org][uncertainty quantification]] and accurate projections are major goals of
mrcal. To achive these, mrcal supports /splined/ models. At this time there's
only one representation supported: a /splined stereographic/ model, described in
detail [[file:lensmodels.org::#splined-stereographic-lens-model][here]].

** Splined stereographic model definition
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: splined-model-definition
:END:

The basis of a splined stereographic model is a [[file:lensmodels.org::#lensmodel-stereographic][stereographic projection]]. In
this projection, a point that lies an angle $\theta$ off the camera's optical
axis projects to $\left|\vec q - \vec q_\mathrm{center}\right| = 2 f \tan \frac{\theta}{2}$
pixels from the imager center, where $f$ is the focal length. Note that this
representation supports projections behind the camera ($\theta > 90^\circ$) with
a single singularity directly behind the camera. This is unlike the pinhole
model, which has $\left|\vec q - \vec q_\mathrm{center}\right| = f \tan \theta$, and projects
to infinity as $\theta \rightarrow 90^\circ$.

Basing the new model on a stereographic projection lifts the inherent
forward-view-only limitation of =LENSMODEL_OPENCV8=. To give the model enough
flexibility to be able to represent any projection function, I define two
correction surfaces.

Let $\vec p$ be the camera-coordinate system point being projected. The angle
off the optical axis is

\[ \theta \equiv \tan^{-1} \frac{\left| \vec p_{xy} \right|}{p_z} \]

The /normalized/ stereographic projection is

\[ \vec u \equiv \frac{\vec p_{xy}}{\left| \vec p_{xy} \right|} 2 \tan\frac{\theta}{2} \]

This initial projection operation unambiguously collapses the 3D point $\vec p$
into a 2D point $\vec u$. We then use $\vec u$ to look-up an
adjustment factor $\Delta \vec u$ using two splined surfaces: one for each of
the two elements of

\[ \Delta \vec u \equiv
\left[ \begin{aligned}
\Delta u_x \left( \vec u \right) \\
\Delta u_y \left( \vec u \right)
\end{aligned} \right] \]

We can then define the rest of the projection function:

\[\vec q =
 \left[ \begin{aligned}
 f_x \left( u_x + \Delta u_x \right) + c_x \\
 f_y \left( u_y + \Delta u_y \right) + c_y
\end{aligned} \right] \]

The parameters we can optimize are the spline control points and $f_x$, $f_y$,
$c_x$ and $c_y$, the usual focal-length-in-pixels and imager-center values.

Let's run the same exact calibration as before, but using the richer model to

The resulting model is renamed to =splined.cameramodel=, and is available [[file:external/data/board/splined.cameramodel][here]].

The lens model
=LENSMODEL_SPLINED_STEREOGRAPHIC_order=3_Nx=30_Ny=20_fov_x_deg=150= is the only
difference in the command. Unlike =LENSMODEL_OPENCV8=, /this/ model has some
/configuration/ parameters: the spline order (we use cubic splines here), the
spline density (here each spline surface has 30 x 20 knots), and the rough
horizontal field-of-view we support (we specify about 150 degrees horizontal
field of view).

There're over 1000 lens parameters here, but the problem is very sparse, so we
can still process this in a reasonable amount of time.

The =LENSMODEL_OPENCV8= solve had 155 points that fit so poorly, the solver
threw them away as outliers; here we have 219. The difference is a tighter fit,
which resulted in a lower outlier threshold: the RMS reprojection error dropped
from 0.71 pixels to 0.53 pixels. The estimated chessboard shape stayed roughly
the same. These are all what we expect and hope to see.

Let's look at the residual distribution in /this/ solve:

#+end_src

[[file:external/figures/calibration/residuals-histogram-splined.svg]]

This still has the nice bell curve, but the residuals are lower: the data fits
better than before.

Let's look at the worst-fitting single image in /this/ solve:

#+end_src

[[file:external/figures/calibration/worst-splined.png]]

Interestingly, the worst observation here is the same one we saw with
=LENSMODEL_OPENCV8=. But all the errors are significantly smaller than before.
The previous radial pattern is much less pronounced, but it still there.

A sneak peek: this is caused by an assumption of a central projection (assuming
that all rays intersect at a single point). An experimental and
not-entirely-complete [[https://github.com/dkogan/mrcal/tree/noncentral][support for noncentral projection in mrcal exists]], and
works /much/ better. The same frame, fitted with a noncentral projection:

This will be included in a future release of mrcal.

In any case, these errors are small, so let's proceed.

What happens when we look at the image that showed a poor fit in the corner
previously? It was observation 79.

Neat! The model fits the data in the corners now. And what about the residual directions?

/Much/ better than before. Maybe there's still a pattern, but it's not clearly
discernible.

We can also visualize the [[file:lensmodels.org::#splined-stereographic-lens-model][magnitude of the vector field defined by the splined
surfaces]] $\left| \Delta \vec u \right|$:

#+begin_src sh
mrcal-show-splined-model-correction \
  --set 'cbrange [0:0.1]'           \
  --unset grid                      \
  splined.cameramodel
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh :exports none :eval no-export
D=~/projects/mrcal-doc-external
~/projects/mrcal/mrcal-show-splined-model-correction \
  --set 'cbrange [0:0.1]' \
  --unset grid                      \
  --hardcopy "$D/figures/splined-models/splined-magnitude.png" \
  --terminal 'pngcairo size 1024,768 transparent noenhanced crop          font ",12"' \
  $D/data/board/splined.cameramodel
#+end_src

[[file:external/figures/splined-models/splined-magnitude.png]]

Each X in the plot is a "knot" of the spline surface, a point where a control
point value is defined. We're looking at the spline domain, so the axes of the
plot are the normalized stereographic projection coordinates $u_x$ and $u_y$,
and the knots are arranged in a regular grid. The region where the spline
surface is well-defined begins at the 2nd knot from the edges; its boundary is
shown as a thin green line. The valid-intrinsics region (the area where the
intrinsics are confident because we had sufficient chessboard observations
there) is shown as a thick, purple curve. Since each $\vec u$ projects to a
pixel coordinate $\vec q$ in some very nonlinear way, this curve is not
straight.

We want the valid-intrinsics region to lie entirely within the spline-in-bounds
region, and that happens here everywhere, except for a tiny sliver at the
bottom-right. If some observations lie outside the spline-in-bounds regions, the
projection behavior there will be less flexible than the rest of the model,
resulting in less realistic uncertainties. See [[file:lensmodels.org::#splined models field of view selection][the lensmodel documentation]] for
more detail.

Alternately, I can look at the spline surface as a function of the pixel
coordinates. Just for $\Delta u_x$:

#+begin_src sh
mrcal-show-splined-model-correction \
  --set 'cbrange [0:0.1]'           \
  --imager-domain                   \
  --set 'xrange [-300:6300]'        \
  --set 'yrange [4300:-300]'        \
  --unset grid                      \
  splined.cameramodel
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh :exports none :eval no-export
D=~/projects/mrcal-doc-external
~/projects/mrcal/mrcal-show-splined-model-correction \
  --set 'cbrange [0:0.1]' \
  --imager-domain          \
  --set 'xrange [-300:6300]'        \
  --set 'yrange [4300:-300]'        \
  --unset grid                      \
  --hardcopy "$D/figures/splined-models/splined-magnitude-imager-domain.png" \
  --terminal 'pngcairo size 1024,768 transparent noenhanced crop font ",12"' \
  $D/data/board/splined.cameramodel
#+end_src

[[file:external/figures/splined-models/splined-magnitude-imager-domain.png]]

Now the valid-intrinsics region is a nice rectangle, but the spline-in-bounds
region is complex curve. Projection at the edges is poorly-defined, so the
boundary of the spline-in-bounds region appears irregular in this view.

I can /also/ look at the correction vector field:
#+begin_src sh
mrcal-show-splined-model-correction \
  --vectorfield \
  --imager-domain \
  --unset grid                      \

  --set 'yrange [4300:-300]'        \
  --gridn 40 30 \
  splined.cameramodel

This doesn't show anything noteworthy in this solve, but seeing this is often
informative with other lenses.
