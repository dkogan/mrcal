* Gathering chessboard corners
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: gathering-corners
:END:

We start by gathering images of a [[file:formulation.org::#calibration-object][chessboard]]. This is a wide lens, so I use a
large chessboard in order to fill the imager (details about why are on the
[[file:tour-choreography.org][choreography page]]). My chessboard has 14x14 internal corners with a
corner-corner spacing of 5.88cm. A big chessboard such as this is never
completely rigid or completely flat. I'm using a board backed with 1in of
aluminum honeycomb, which is both flat and stable. It took several iterations to
settle on this material. See the [[file:how-to-calibrate.org][how-to-calibrate page]] for details.

An important consideration when gathering calibration images is keeping them in
focus. As we shall see [[file:tour-choreography.org][later]], we want to gather as many close-up images as we
can, so depth-of-field is the limiting factor. Moving the focus ring or the
aperture ring affects the intrinsics, so ideally a single lens setting can cover
both the calibration-time closeups and the working distance (presumably much
further out). So for these tests I set the focus to infinity, and gather all my
images at F22 to maximize the depth-of-field. To also avoid motion blur I need
fast exposures, so I did all the image gathering outside, with bright natural
lighting. When gathering real-world calibration data, compromises have to be
made; see the [[file:how-to-calibrate.org][how-to-calibrate page]] for details.

I gathered some [[file:external/2022-11-05--dtla-overpass--samyang--alpha7/2-f22-infinity/images][calibration images]], and used [[https://github.com/dkogan/mrgingham/][mrgingham]] 1.22 to detect the
[[file:external/2022-11-05--dtla-overpass--samyang--alpha7/2-f22-infinity/corners.vnl][chessboard corners]]:

#+begin_src sh

How well did we cover the imager? Did we get the edges and corners?

[[file:external/figures/calibration/mrgingham-coverage.png]]

We did OK, except maybe at the top center. This is a good quick/dirty
visualization, but as we'll see later, [[file:tour-uncertainty.org][we can do much better]].

For an arbitrary image we can visualize the corner detections:

#+begin_example
$ < corners.vnl head -n5

#+end_src

[[file:external/figures/calibration/mrgingham-results.png]]

So in this image many of the corners were detected at full-resolution (level-0),
but some required downsampling for the detector to find them. This is indicated
by smaller circles. The downsampled points have less precision, so they are
[[file:formulation.org::#noise-in-measurement-vector][weighed less in the optimization]]. How many images produced successful corner
detections?

#+begin_example
$ < corners.vnl vnl-filter --has x -p filename | uniq | grep -v '#' | wc -l

84
#+end_example

So we have 84 images with detected corners even though we captured 115 images.
Most of the misses were probably images where the chessboard wasn't entirely in
view, but some could be failures of mrgingham. In any case, 84 observations is
usually plenty.

If I had more that one camera, the image filenames would need to indicate what
camera captured each image at which time. I usually name my images
=frameFFF-cameraCCC.jpg=. Images with the same =FFF= are assumed to have been
captured at the same instant in time. The exact pattern doesn't matter, but a
constant pattern with a changing =FFF= and =CCC= are required.

* Monocular calibration with the 8-parameter opencv model
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: opencv8-model-solving
:END:

Let's calibrate! We begin with a lean model used commonly for wide lenses in
other tools: [[file:lensmodels.org::#lensmodel-opencv][=LENSMODEL_OPENCV8=]]. Primarily this works via a rational radial
"distortion" model. Projecting $\vec p$ in the camera coordinate system:

\begin{aligned}
\vec P &\equiv \frac{\vec p_{xy}}{p_z} \\
r &\equiv \left|\vec P\right|            \\
\vec P_\mathrm{radial} &\equiv \frac{ 1 + k_0 r^2 + k_1 r^4 + k_4 r^6}{ 1 + k_5 r^2 + k_6 r^4 + k_7 r^6} \vec P \\
\vec q &= \vec f_{xy} \left( \vec P_\mathrm{radial} + \cdots \right) + \vec c_{xy}
\end{aligned}

where $\vec q$ is the resulting projected pixel, $k_i$ are the distortion
parameters, $\vec f_{xy}$ is the focal lengths and $\vec c_{xy}$ is the center
pixel of the imager.

Let's compute the calibration using the [[file:mrcal-calibrate-cameras.html][=mrcal-calibrate-cameras=]] tool:

#+begin_src sh
mrcal-calibrate-cameras         \
  --corners-cache corners.vnl   \
  --lensmodel LENSMODEL_OPENCV8 \
  --focal 1900                  \
  --object-spacing 0.0588       \
  --object-width-n 14           \
  '*.JPG'
#+end_src

I'm specifying the initial rough estimate of the focal length (in pixels), the
geometry of my chessboard, the lens model I want to use, chessboard corners we
just detected and the image globs. I have just one camera, so I have one glob:
=*.JPG=. With more cameras you'd have something like ='*-camera0.jpg'
'*-camera1.jpg' '*-camera2.jpg'=.

The [[file:mrcal-calibrate-cameras.html][=mrcal-calibrate-cameras=]] tool reports some high-level diagnostics, writes
the output model(s) to disk, and exits:

#+begin_example

calobject_warp = [-0.00012726 -0.00014325]

Wrote /tmp/camera-0.cameramodel
#+end_example

The resulting model is available [[file:external/2022-11-05--dtla-overpass--samyang--alpha7/2-f22-infinity/opencv8.cameramodel][here]]. This is a [[file:cameramodels.org][mrcal-native =.cameramodel=
file]] containing at least the lens parameters and the geometry.

We want to flag down any issues with the data that would violate the [[file:formulation.org::#noise-model][assumptions
made by the solver]]. Let's start by sanity-checking the results.

As we can see in the console output, the final RMS reprojection error was 0.4
pixels. Of the 16464 corner observations (84 observations of the board with
14*14 points each), 564 didn't fit the model well-enough, and were thrown out as
[[file:formulation.org::#outlier-rejection][outliers]]. The [[file:formulation.org::#board-deformation][board flex]] was computed as .13mm horizontally, and 0.14mm
vertically. That all sounds reasonable.

Let's examine the solution further. We can either

- =mrcal-calibrate-cameras --explore ...= to drop into a REPL after the
  computation is done. This allows us to look around in the Python session where
  the solution was computed.

- Use the [[file:commandline-tools.org][=mrcal-show-...= commandline tools]] on the generated =xxx.cameramodel=
  files

The =--explore= REPL can produce deeper feedback, but the commandline tools are
more convenient, so I here I talk about those.

What does the solve think about our geometry? Does it match reality?

Here we see the [[file:formulation.org::#world-geometry][axes of our camera]] (purple) situated at the [[file:formulation.org::#world-geometry][reference coordinate
system]]. In this solve, the camera coordinate system /is/ the reference
coordinate system; this would look more interesting with more cameras. In front
of the camera (along the $z$ axis) we can see the solved chessboard poses. There
are a whole lot of them, and they're all sitting right in front of the camera
with some heavy tilt. This matches with how this chessboard dance was performed:
I followed the guidelines of the [[file:tour-choreography.org][dance study]].

Next, let's examine the residuals more closely. We have an overall RMS
reprojection error value from above, but let's look at the full distribution of
errors for /all/ the cameras:

[[file:external/figures/calibration/residuals-histogram-opencv8.svg]]

We would like to see a normal distribution (since that's what the [[file:formulation.org::#noise-model][noise model]]
assumes), and we roughly do see that here. If the images were captured with
varying illumination (which happens with different board orientations and a
directional light source), the center cluster or the tails would get
over-populated. That would be a violation of the noise model, bit things still
appear to work OK even in that case.

Let's look deeper. If there's anything really wrong with our data, then we
should see it in the worst-fitting images. Let's ask the tool to show us the
worst image:

[[file:external/figures/calibration/worst-opencv8.png]]

The residual vector for each chessboard corner in this observation is shown,
scaled by a factor of 200 for legibility (the actual errors are tiny!) The
circle color also indicates the magnitude of the errors. The size of each circle
represents the weight given to that point. The weight is reduced for points that
were detected at a lower resolution by the chessboard detector. Points thrown
out as outliers are not shown at all.

Residual plots such as this one are a good way to identify common data-gathering
issues such as:

- out-of focus images
- images with motion blur
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_shutter][rolling shutter]] effects
- synchronization errors
- chessboard detector failures
- insufficiently-rich models (of the lens or of the chessboard shape or anything
  else)

See the [[file:how-to-calibrate.org][how-to-calibrate page]] for practical details. Back to /this/ image. In
absolute terms, even this worst-fitting image fits /really/ well. The RMS error
of the errors in this image is 0.70 pixels. The residuals in this image look
mostly reasonable. There is an issue, however: if the model fit this data, the
residuals would sample independent, random noise, and would be uncorrelated.
/Here/ there's a pattern: the errors are mostly radial in the chessboard (point
to/from the center). A unmodeled chessboard flex could cause this kind of
problem, for instance. This is a source of bias in his solution. Let's keep
going, keeping this in mind.

One issue with lean models such as =LENSMODEL_OPENCV8= (used here) is that the
radial distortion is never quite right, especially as we move further and
further away from the optical axis: this is the last point in the common-errors
list above. The result of these radial distortion errors is high residuals in
the corners and near the edges of the image. We can clearly see this here in the
10th-worst image (10th worst and not /the/ worst because the /really/
poor-fitting points are thrown out as outliers):

Clearly /this/ image is a problem: the points near the corners have poor
residuals, and the entire column of points at the edge was thrown out as
outliers. We note that this is observation 47, so that we can come back to it
later.

And we can see this same high-error-in-the-corners effect in the residual

In addition to the expected high errors at the edges, this plot also shows an
anomalous ring of poorly-fitting observations at the center. This could maybe be
caused by the solver sacrificing accuracy at the center of the image to get a
better fit in the much larger areas further out? We shall see in a bit. Let's
look at the systematic errors in another way: let's look at all the residuals
over all the observations, color-coded by their direction, ignoring the
magnitudes:

As before, if the model fit the observations, the errors would represent random
noise, and no color pattern would be discernible in these dots. Here we can
clearly see the colors clustered together. This is not random noise, and is a
/very/ clear indication that this lens model is not able to fit this data.

It would be good to have a quantitative measure of these systematic patterns. At
this time mrcal doesn't provide an automated way to do that. This will be added
in the future.

Clearly there're unmodeled errors in this solve. As we have seen, the errors
here are all fairly small, but they become important when doing precision work
like, for instance, long-range stereo.

Let's fix it.

* Monocular calibration with a splined stereographic model
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: splined-stereographic-fit
:END:

Usable [[file:uncertainty.org][uncertainty quantification]] and accurate projections are major goals of
mrcal. To achive these, mrcal supports a /splined stereographic/ model,
described in detail [[file:splined-models.org][here]], and summarized below. We use this splined
stereographic model to more precisely model the behavior or this lens.

** Splined stereographic model definition
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: splined-model-definition
:END:

The basis of a splined stereographic model is a [[file:lensmodels.org::#lensmodel-stereographic][stereographic projection]]. In
this projection, a point that lies an angle $\theta$ off the camera's optical
axis projects to $\left|\vec q - \vec q_\mathrm{center}\right| = 2 f \tan
\frac{\theta}{2}$ pixels from the imager center, where $f$ is the focal length.
Note that this representation supports projections behind the camera ($\theta >
90^\circ$) with a single singularity directly behind the camera. This is unlike
the pinhole model, which has $\left|\vec q - \vec q_\mathrm{center}\right| = f
\tan \theta$, and projects to infinity as $\theta \rightarrow 90^\circ$. The
pinhole model can /not/ represent projections behind the imager.

Basing the new model on a stereographic projection lifts the inherent
forward-view-only limitation of =LENSMODEL_OPENCV8=.

Let $\vec p$ be the camera-coordinate system point being projected. The angle
off the optical axis is

\[ \theta \equiv \tan^{-1} \frac{\left| \vec p_{xy} \right|}{p_z} \]

The /normalized/ stereographic projection is

\[ \vec u \equiv \frac{\vec p_{xy}}{\left| \vec p_{xy} \right|} 2 \tan\frac{\theta}{2} \]

This initial projection operation unambiguously collapses the 3D point $\vec p$
into a 2D vector $\vec u$. We then use $\vec u$ to look-up an adjustment factor
$\Delta \vec u$ using two splined surfaces: one for each of the two elements:

\[ \Delta \vec u \equiv
\left[ \begin{aligned}
\Delta u_x \left( \vec u \right) \\
\Delta u_y \left( \vec u \right)
\end{aligned} \right] \]

We can then define the rest of the projection function:

\[\vec q =
 \left[ \begin{aligned}
 f_x \left( u_x + \Delta u_x \right) + c_x \\
 f_y \left( u_y + \Delta u_y \right) + c_y
\end{aligned} \right] \]

The parameters we can optimize are the spline control points and $f_x$, $f_y$,
$c_x$ and $c_y$, the usual focal-length-in-pixels and imager-center values.

Let's run the same exact calibration as before, but using the richer model to
specify the lens:

#+end_example

The resulting model is available [[file:external/2022-11-05--dtla-overpass--samyang--alpha7/2-f22-infinity/splined.cameramodel][here]].

The requested lens model
=LENSMODEL_SPLINED_STEREOGRAPHIC_order=3_Nx=30_Ny=18_fov_x_deg=150= is the only
difference in the command. Unlike =LENSMODEL_OPENCV8=, /this/ model has some
/configuration/ parameters: the spline order (we use cubic splines here), the
spline density (here each spline surface has 30 x 18 knots), and the rough
horizontal field-of-view we support (we specify about 150 degrees horizontal
field of view). These parameters are fixed in the model, and are not subject to
optimization.

There're over 1000 lens parameters here, but the problem is sparse, so we can
still process this in a reasonable amount of time.

The =LENSMODEL_OPENCV8= solve above had 564 points that fit so poorly, the
solver threw them away as outliers; here we have 28. The RMS reprojection error
dropped from 0.4 pixels to 0.2 pixels. The estimated chessboard shape stayed
roughly the same: flat. These are all what we expect and hope to see.

Let's look at the residual distribution in /this/ solve, compared to before:

This still has the nice bell curve, but the residuals are lower: the data fits
better than before.

Interestingly, the worst observation here is the same one we saw with
=LENSMODEL_OPENCV8=, so we can do a nice side-by-side comparison:

[[file:external/figures/calibration/worst-opencv8-splined-animation.gif]]

All the errors are significantly smaller. The previous radial pattern is still
there, but is much less pronounced.

Sometimes noncentral solves clearly fix this, and I can talk about it (notes
here). Cross-validation is a better place to talk about it, anyway.

A sneak peek: this is caused by an assumption of a central projection (assuming
that all rays intersect at a single point). An experimental and
not-entirely-complete [[https://github.com/dkogan/mrcal/tree/noncentral][support
for noncentral projection in mrcal]] exists, and works /much/ better. The same
frame, fitted with a noncentral projection:

This will be included in a future release of mrcal.

In any case, these errors are small, so let's proceed.

/Much/ better than before: the color clustering is /gone/. The poorly-fitting
ring in the center is still there, but it is being modeled by this splined model
far better than how =LENSMODEL_OPENCV8= did (error magnitudes are much better).
We /do/ still see a clear pattern in the directions inside the ring, so it could
still be improved: a denser spline spacing would do better. This is a peculiar
image processing artifact of the Sony Alpha 7 III camera: from experience, other
cameras using this lens do not exhibit this effect.

We can also visualize the [[file:splined-models.org][magnitude of the vector field defined by the splined
surfaces]] $\left| \Delta \vec u \right|$:

Each X in the plot is a "knot" of the spline surface, a point where a control
point value is defined. We're looking at the spline domain, so the axes of the
plot are the normalized stereographic projection coordinates $u_x$ and $u_y$,
and the knots are arranged in a regular grid. The region where the spline
surface is well-defined begins at the 2nd knot from the edges; its boundary is
shown as a thin green line. The valid-intrinsics region (the area where the
intrinsics are confident because we had sufficient chessboard observations
there) is shown as a thick, green curve. Since each $\vec u$ projects to a pixel
coordinate $\vec q$ in some nonlinear way, this curve is not straight.

We want the valid-intrinsics region to lie entirely within the spline-in-bounds
region, and we get that here nicely. If some observations did lie outside the
spline-in-bounds regions, the projection behavior there would be less flexible
than the rest of the model, resulting in less realistic uncertainties, and a
larger-fov splined model would be more appropriate. See [[file:splined-models.org::#splined models field of view selection][the lensmodel
documentation]] for more detail.

Alternately, I can look at the spline surface as a function of the pixel
coordinates:

Now the valid-intrinsics region is straight, but the spline-in-bounds region is
a curve. Projection at the edges is poorly-defined, so the boundary of the
spline-in-bounds region appears irregular in this view.

I can /also/ look at the correction vector field:

This doesn't show anything noteworthy in this solve, but seeing it is often
informative with other lenses.
