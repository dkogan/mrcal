#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* New in mrcal 2.2

This is a mostly-maintenance release. Many bugs were fixed. Many things were
cleaned up. Lots of internal updates to pave the way for big future features.
/Some/ new features and nice improvements in /this/ release also, but they don't
represent the bulk of the changes.

** Stereo processing

- The [[file:mrcal-stereo.html][=mrcal-stereo=]] tool includes an interactive, graphical visualizer,
  accessed with =mrcal-stereo --viz stereo=. This allows the user to quickly
  assess the quality of the stereo result, the ranges, epipolar misalignment,
  and sensitivity to errors. Requires [[https://pyfltk.sourceforge.io/][pyfltk]] and [[https://github.com/dkogan/GL_image_display][GL_image_display]]

- Since the [[file:mrcal-stereo.html][=mrcal-stereo=]] tool now has multiple visualizers, the
  =--show-geometry= option has been renamed to =--viz geometry=

- The [[file:mrcal-stereo.html][=mrcal-stereo=]] tool can write out a point cloud in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)][=.ply= format]] if
  invoked with the =--write-point-cloud= option

- The [[file:mrcal-stereo.html][=mrcal-stereo=]] tool can use the [[https://www.cvlibs.net/software/libelas/][libelas stereo matcher]] instead of the
  default [[https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d2/d85/classcv_1_1StereoSGBM.html][SGBM matcher in OpenCV]] if invoked with =--stereo-matcher ELAS=.
  Requires [[https://www.cvlibs.net/software/libelas/][libelas]].

- The [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-stereo_range][=mrcal.stereo_range()=]] function can accept scalar disparities

- Added [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-stereo_unproject][=mrcal.stereo_unproject()=]] function to compute 3D points directly,
  instead of explicitly calling [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-stereo_range][=mrcal.stereo_range()=]] first

- The [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-rectified_system][=mrcal.rectified_system()=]] function returns an additional dict of metadata
  if invoked with =return_metadata = True=. This is useful to determine the
  computed stereo resolution and field-of-view parameters

** [[https://www.github.com/dkogan/mrcal/blob/master/poseutils.py][=poseutils=]]

- The =pq= transform representation was replaced with the [[file:conventions.org::#pose-representation][=qt= representation]],
  which is analogous to the [[file:conventions.org::#pose-representation][=rt= representation]]. Consequently the
  =mrcal.pq_from_Rt()=, =mrcal.Rt_from_pq()= functions have been replaced with
  [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-qt_from_Rt][=mrcal.qt_from_Rt()=]], [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-Rt_from_qt][=mrcal.Rt_from_qt()=]] functions. These are available only
  in the Python layer.

- [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-quat_from_R][=mrcal.quat_from_R()=]] and [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-R_from_quat][=mrcal.R_from_quat()=]] are now implemented in C,
  broadcast fully, and support in-place output. Like the rest of the
  [[https://www.github.com/dkogan/mrcal/blob/master/poseutils.py][=poseutils=]]. These are available only in the Python layer.

- Added [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-compose_r][=mrcal.compose_r()=]] function for direct composition of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis%E2%80%93angle_representation#Rotation_vector][Rodrigues
  rotations]], /without/ transforming to a rotation matrix first. This is
  available in both the Python and C layers

- Added [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-skew_symmetric][=mrcal.skew_symmetric()=]] function for a matrix-multiplication-based
  cross-product. This is available only in the Python layer

** Other

- Most functions in the Python API now accept non-essential arguments as
  keywords only. Most common usages should remain functional, but code that used
  too many positional arguments in calls will need to be ported. This will
  increase the readability of that code, and this change makes it easier to
  maintain API compatibility in the future

- The [[file:conventions.org::#symbols-optimization][variable convention used for the optimization state]] changed to $\vec b$
  from $\vec p$. Previously, $\vec p$ was used to denote both optimization state
  and points in space, with this ambiguity being clear from context. However,
  too many times we'd see a situation where this /wasn't/ clear from context.
  Renaming this clears up the ambiguity. This isn't a functional change, but
  affects lots of documentation, comments and variable names.

- Added [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-load_image][=mrcal.load_image()=]] and [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-save_image][=mrcal.save_image()=]] functions to both the
  Python and C APIs. These aren't special in any way, but are convenient, and
  allow us to avoid OpenCV, which is slow and massive. Requires [[https://freeimage.sourceforge.io/][libfreeimage]]

- The [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-mrcal-triangulate][=mrcal.mrcal-triangulate()=]] tool now has a =--clahe= option to apply
  equalization to the input images prior to processing

- The [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-ref_calibration_object][=mrcal.ref_calibration_object()=]] function can accept different spacings in
  the horizontal and vertical directions

- The [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-ref_calibration_object][=mrcal.ref_calibration_object()=]] function can broadcast over
  =object_spacing= and =calobject_warp=

- The code can be cross-built, if invoked from the Debian build tools
  (=DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH= and the compiler and linker environment variables set)

- The [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-compute_chessboard_corners][=mrcal.compute_chessboard_corners()=]] function API was cleaned up. Many
  arguments have different names, and most of them are only accepted as
  keywords. The =weight_column_kind= argument must be one of ='level'= or
  ='weight'= or =None=.

- The =mrcal-to-cameramodel= tool was renamed to [[file:mrcal-from-cahvor.html][=mrcal-from-cahvor=]] to make it
  easier to support future format converters.

- The [[file:mrcal-calibrate-cameras.html][=mrcal-calibrate-cameras=]] tool now reports its "RMS error" as the RMS
  error of the measurement vector. Each pixel observation produces 2 measurement
  values: the error in $x$ and $y$. Prior to this release I reported the RMS
  error treating such a pair as /one/ value: $\sqrt{\frac{\left\Vert \vec x
  \right\Vert^2}{\frac{N_\mathrm{measurement}}{2}}}$. This was in conflict with
  other parts of the code, so now I report this as two separate values:
  $\sqrt{\frac{\left\Vert \vec x \right\Vert^2}{N_\mathrm{measurement}}$. So now
  the reported RMS error is just $\mathrm{Var} \left( \vec x \right)$

- The [[file:mrcal-convert-lensmodel.html][=mrcal-convert-lensmodel=]] tool has nicer commandline options:

  - The =--viz= output plot can be controlled and written to disk by passing
    =--set=, =--unset=, =--hardcopy=, etc. Same as with the
    [[file:mrcal-show-projection-diff.html][=mrcal-show-projection-diff=]].
  - The output model is written to a file on disk instead of to stdout. This is
    incompatible with previously behavior, but is much nicer
  - =--radius= and =--where= work even without =--sampled=

- [[file:mrcal-calibrate-cameras.html][=mrcal-calibrate-cameras=]] and [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-seed_stereographic][=mrcal.seed_stereographic()=]] can accept multiple
  estimates for focal length: one estimate per camera. Useful in seeding
  calibration problems containing multiple disparate cameras

* Migration notes 2.1 -> 2.2
The vast majority of existing usage remains the same, but some updates described
above will require a code change:

- Most of the Python API functions now use keyword-only arguments for the
  non-essential arguments. Any calls that used too many positional arguments
  will need to be clarified with keywords

- =mrcal.pq_from_Rt()= calls must be replaced with [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-qt_from_Rt][=mrcal.qt_from_Rt()=]], and the
  caller must use the [[file:conventions.org::#pose-representation][=qt= transform representation]]

- =mrcal.Rt_from_pq()= calls must be replaced with [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-Rt_from_qt][=mrcal.Rt_from_qt()=]], and the
  caller must use the [[file:conventions.org::#pose-representation][=qt= transform representation]]

- =mrcal-stereo --show-geometry= is now invoked as =mrcal-stereo --viz geometry=

- The =mrcal-to-cameramodel= tool was renamed to [[file:mrcal-from-cahvor.html][=mrcal-from-cahvor=]]

- A C header was renamed: =basic_geometry.h= -> [[https://www.github.com/dkogan/mrcal/blob/master/basic_geometry.h][=basic_geometry.h=]], requiring an
  =#include= update

- The [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-compute_chessboard_corners][=mrcal.compute_chessboard_corners()=]] function API was changed. If you're
  using this, please see the documentation

- The [[file:mrcal-convert-lensmodel.html][=mrcal-convert-lensmodel=]] tool writes the output model to a file on disk,
  not to stdout as it has previously. New usage will need to be adjusted
