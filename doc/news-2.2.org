#+TITLE: mrcal 2.2 release notes
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* New in mrcal 2.2
fixed outlier weighing

mrcal-stereo --viz

build update: I can cross-compile

quaternion support improved:

quat_from_R() improved
R_from_quat() improved
qt_from_Rt() new
Rt_from_qt() new
pq_from_Rt() removed
Rt_from_pq() removed

- diff functions. If the distance is iterable, the shape of the output of the
  internal functions is (len(distance), ...). Otherwise it is just (...). This
  is what the caller would expect

- diff functions. If multiple distances are given, we computed the implied
  transformation using ALL of them, but we display the diff from the FIRST given
  distance.

** mrcal-show-projection-diff --valid-intrinsics-region handles camera-1

Prior to this patch the region for the second camera was not being computed or
displayed properly



* Migration notes 2.1 -> 2.2
This is a /very/ minor release, and is 99.9% compatible. The only incompatible
update:

- Replace pq_from_Rt(),Rt_from_pq() with qt_from_Rt(),Rt_from_qt()
