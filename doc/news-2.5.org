#+TITLE: mrcal 2.5 release notes
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* New in mrcal 2.5
This is yet another mostly-maintenance release. /Most/ of the implementation of
some new big features is committed, but not yet completed and tested. These are
thus lightly tested and documented, until they're done and finally appear in
mrcal 3.0:

- Cross-reprojection uncertainty, to be able to perform full calibrations with a
  splined model and /without/ a chessboard
- More general view of uncertainty. I want to support extrinsics and/or
  intrinsics uncertainty computation, in lots of scenarios
- Implicit point solves, using the triangulation routines in the optimization
  cost function. Should produce much more efficient structure-from-motion
  solves. This is all the "triangulated-features" stuff. The
  =_mrcal_triangulated_error()= function is the core part of the cost function,
  and this is already demoed in [[https://www.github.com/dkogan/mrcal/blob/master/test/test-sfm-triangulated-points.py][=test/test-sfm-triangulated-points.py=]]

And other than that, there are lots and lots of smaller fixes and improvements.

** General fixes

- Poseutils: more careful handling of rotations near singularities. Rotations by
  ~ 180deg in particular weren't implemented properly, and had bugs that are now
  fixed.

- Renamed "residuals" -> "measurements" to clarify the nomenclature. These are
  similar except for scaling and the "measurements" may also contain
  regularization.
  - =residuals_point()= -> =measurements_point()=
  - =residuals_board()= -> =measurements_board()=
  - =show_residuals_....()= functions now ask for a measurement =x= argument;
    the old =residuals= argument is still accepted for backwards compatibility

- Added =mrcal_traverse_sensor_links()= in C and =mrcal.traverse_sensor_links()=
  in Python. These compute the best path through a graph of sensors, trying to
  maximize the common observations between each successive pair of sensors in
  the path. The general min-heap implementation at the core of this computation
  is available in =heap.h=

- [[file:mrcal-calibrate-cameras.html][=mrcal-calibrate-cameras=]] and [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-compute_chessboard_corners][=mrcal.compute_chessboard_corners()=]] have a
  higher minimum points-per-chessboard-observation threshold (new
  =Npoint_observations_per_board_min= kwarg in the function). We now throw out
  any images where a chessboard detection has fewer than
  =2*min(gridn_width,gridn_height)= points. This is irrelevant for =mrgingham=,
  which produces all-or-nothing detections, but other detectors could produce
  barely-adequate detections that could cause problems previously

- [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-compute_chessboard_corners][=mrcal.compute_chessboard_corners()=]] has new =image_path_prefix= and
  =image_directory= kwargs to provide more options for interpreting paths in the
  given =corners_cache_vnl=. This is analogous to how other parts of mrcal work
  (for instance the [[file:mrcal-show-residuals-board-observation.html][=mrcal-show-residuals-board-observation=]] tool).

- The [[file:mrcal-calibrate-cameras.html][=mrcal-calibrate-cameras=]] use that function, and now has
  =--image-path-prefix= and =--image-directory=. Useful to make =--imagersize=
  unnecessary and to have image overlays working with =--explore=. This are
  especially helpful if calibrating a system with different-resolution cameras.
  In that case =--imagersize= doesn't work, and finding the images on disk is
  required

- Added [[https://www.github.com/dkogan/mrcal/blob/master/analyses/validate-input-noise.py][=analyses/validate-input-noise.py=]] and
  [[https://www.github.com/dkogan/mrcal/blob/master/analyses/validate-uncertainty.py][=analyses/validate-uncertainty.py=]] and [[https://www.github.com/dkogan/mrcal/blob/master/analyses/validate-noncentral.py][=analyses/validate-noncentral.py=]]
  tools. These are /very/ useful to check the various assumptions made by the
  mrcal processing

- The [[file:mrcal-convert-lensmodel.html][=mrcal-convert-lensmodel=]] tool has =--all= to write out /all/ the models
  from a joint re-solve

- Added new [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-model_resolution__deg_pixel][=mrcal.model_resolution__deg_pixel()=]] function and the
  [[file:mrcal-show-model-resolution.html][=mrcal-show-model-resolution=]] tool

- [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-show_distortion_off_pinhole_radial][=mrcal.show_distortion_off_pinhole_radial()=]] works with all models, not just
  opencv ones

- The image load/save functions no longer use [[https://freeimage.sourceforge.io/][libfreeimage]], since that library
  is unmaintained. I'm using [[https://github.com/nothings/stb][libstb]] for image-reading and [[https://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html][libpng]] and
  [[https://libjpeg-turbo.org/][libjpeg-turbo]] for image-writing. libstb can write images too, but there were
  several limitations that made it necessary to use the dedicated libraries.
  This means that currently I can write /only/ =.png= and =.jpg= images. This
  can be extended if needed.

- The [[file:mrcal-cull-corners.html][=mrcal-cull-corners=]] tool has =--cull-rad-off-center-board= to throw out
  chessboard edges. Useful if we dont trust the chessboard shape

- Added [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#cameramodel-optimization_inputs_reset][=mrcal.cameramodel.optimization_inputs_reset()=]] and
  [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#cameramodel-valid_intrinsics_region_reset][=mrcal.cameramodel.valid_intrinsics_region_reset()=]] to unset these fields in a
  [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#cameramodel][=mrcal.cameramodel=]].

- Added the [[https://www.github.com/dkogan/mrcal/blob/master/analyses/mrcal-convert-lensmodel-from-kalibr-fov][=analyses/mrcal-convert-lensmodel-from-kalibr-fov=]] tool to fit a
  Kalibr "fov" model into something that mrcal supports. This isn't
  general-enough or tested-enough to be fully distributed yet, so run it from
  the mrcal source tree if you need it

- Added =mrcal_cameramodel_converter()= "converter" function that can be used
  with =O&= conversions in [[https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/arg.html#c.PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords][=PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords()=]] calls. Can interpret
  either path strings or [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#cameramodel][=mrcal.cameramodel=]] objects as
  =mrcal_cameramodel_VOID_t= C structures. Useful for writing Python extension
  modules for C code that uses =mrcal_cameramodel_VOID_t=.

- Some fields in the [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#cameramodel][=mrcal.cameramodel=]] type and the saved =.cameramodel= files
  and the =optimization_inputs= C and Python interfaces were renamed:

  \begin{aligned}
  &\mathrm{extrinsics\_rt\_fromref} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{rt\_cam\_ref} \\
  &\mathrm{extrinsics\_Rt\_fromref} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{Rt\_cam\_ref} \\
  &\mathrm{extrinsics\_rt\_toref} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{rt\_ref\_cam} \\
  &\mathrm{extrinsics\_Rt\_toref} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{Rt\_ref\_cam} \\
  &\mathrm{frames\_rt\_fromref} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{rt\_frame\_ref} \\
  &\mathrm{frames\_Rt\_fromref} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{Rt\_frame\_ref} \\
  &\mathrm{frames\_rt\_toref} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{rt\_ref\_frame} \\
  &\mathrm{frames\_Rt\_toref} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{Rt\_ref\_frame} \\
  &\end{aligned}

  This makes things more consistent. Compatibility logic is in place, so old
  code and data should keep working. New =.cameramodel= files write both the new
  and old fields, so old tools can read the new files.

- Transform composition functions have new arguments: =inverted0= and
  =inverted1=, to make it easier to use inverted transforms. The C macros
  =mrcal_compose_Rt()=, =mrcal_compose_rt()=, =mrcal_compose_r()= are unchanged,
  with new macros available to apply the inverses: =...._inverted0()=,
  =...._inverted1()=, =...._inverted01()=. The corresponding
  =mrcal_compose_..._full()= C functions have new arguments; *this breaks the
  API and ABI*. The Python functions [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-compose_r][=mrcal.compose_r()=]] and
  [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-compose_rt][=mrcal.compose_rt()=]] and [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-compose_R][=mrcal.compose_R()=]] have new kwargs with default
  values, so this API remains compatible.

** Stereo
- =mrcal_rectified_system()= and [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-rectified_system][=mrcal.rectified_system()=]] fail if the
  rectified camera looks near the direction of the baseline vector. If =az0_deg=
  is being auto-detected, it will be shifted to avoid looking along the baseline

- =mrcal_rectified_system2()= is a new flavor of =mrcal_rectified_system()= to
  provide a new =az_edge_margin_deg= argument, to set the closest the rectified
  view is allowed to get to $\mathrm{az}=\pm 90^\circ$. The legacy function
  still exists, defaulting to =az_edge_margin_deg=10=. [[file:mrcal-stereo.html][=mrcal-stereo=]]
  controls this via =--az-edge-margin-deg=

- Similarly the Python [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-rectified_system][=mrcal.rectified_system()=]] function now takes this
  =az_edge_margin_deg= argument also

- [[file:mrcal-stereo.html][=mrcal-stereo=]]: =--equalization= implies =--force-grayscale=

- [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-stereo_range][=mrcal.stereo_range()=]] has a better default for disparity_max to handle
  invalid disparities reliably in the common case where the disparity is a
  16-bit signed integer

** C API 
- Added C implementations of Procrustes fits:
  =mrcal_align_procrustes_vectors_R01()= and
  =mrcal_align_procrustes_points_Rt01()=. These are now the internal
  implementations of the Python [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-align_procrustes_vectors_R01][=mrcal.align_procrustes_vectors_R01()=]] and
  [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-align_procrustes_points_Rt01][=mrcal.align_procrustes_points_Rt01()=]] functions

- Added =mrcal_R_aligned_to_vector()= C function. This is now the internal
  implementation of [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-R_aligned_to_vector][=mrcal.R_aligned_to_vector()=]]

- Added simple math operation functions to the C API:
  - =double         mrcal_point3_inner(const mrcal_point3_t a, const mrcal_point3_t b)=
  - =double         mrcal_point3_norm2(const mrcal_point3_t a)=
  - =double         mrcal_point3_mag  (const mrcal_point3_t a)=
  - =mrcal_point3_t mrcal_point3_add  (const mrcal_point3_t a, const mrcal_point3_t b)=
  - =mrcal_point3_t mrcal_point3_sub  (const mrcal_point3_t a, const mrcal_point3_t b)=
  - =mrcal_point3_t mrcal_point3_scale(const mrcal_point3_t a, const double s)=
  - =mrcal_point3_t mrcal_point3_cross(const mrcal_point3_t a, const mrcal_point3_t b)=

  And similar for =mrcal_point2_t=, except there's no =mrcal_point2_cross()=

- Added simple point and pose printing utilities:
  - =mrcal_point2_print(p)=
  - =mrcal_point3_print(p)=
  - =mrcal_Rt_print(Rt)=
  - =mrcal_rt_print(rt)=

- =mrcal_image_uint8_load()= applies stretch equalization if given a 16-bit
  image. This is a reasonable default. If more specific processing is needed,
  call =mrcal_image_uint16_load()=. Applies to [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-load_image][=mrcal.load_image()=]] also.

- Added =mrcal_image_void_t= image type for generic functions that aren't meant
  to interface with any particular image type. The [[https://www.github.com/dkogan/mrcal/blob/master/image.h][=mrcal_image_anytype_load()=]]
  function now uses that type.

- All headers have C++ =extern "C"= wrappers for direct =#include= in C++
  projects

- Renamed =mrcal_cameramodel_t= -> =mrcal_cameramodel_VOID_t= to clarify that
  the specific lensmodel type is unknown here. The legacy alias
  =mrcal_cameramodel_t= is still available for backwards-compatibility

- Added =mrcal_intrinsics_XXX_t= structures to represent camera intrinsics.
  These are exactly like =mrcal_cameramodel_XXX_t= but without the extrinsics

- The C API can read models into a preallocated buffer intead of forcing
  allocation, as before. New functions:
  #+begin_src c
  bool mrcal_read_cameramodel_string_into(// out
                                          mrcal_cameramodel_VOID_t* model,
                                          // in,out
                                          int* Nintrinsics_max,
                                          // in
                                          const char* string,
                                          const int len);

  bool mrcal_read_cameramodel_file_into  (// out
                                          mrcal_cameramodel_VOID_t* model,
                                          // in,out
                                          int* Nintrinsics_max,
                                          // in
                                          const char* filename);
  #+end_src

* Migration notes 2.4 -> 2.5

- =mrcal_compose_rt_full()= and =mrcal_compose_Rt_full()= C functions have two
  new arguments: =inverted0=, =inverted1=. Most callers use the
  =mrcal_..._compose()= macros, so for them only the ABI has changed, and a
  rebuild is sufficient.

- =mrcal_compose_rt_full()= C function can return =dt01_dr1= and =dt01_dt0=.
  Most callers use the =mrcal_..._compose()= macros, so for them only the ABI
  has changed, and a rebuild is sufficient.

- The C types =mrcal_cameramodel_XXX_t= no longer have a generic member
  =mrcal_cameramodel_t m=. If you need a generic alias of
  =mrcal_cameramodel_XXX_t* model= you now need to
  =(mrcal_cameramodel_VOID_t*)model= instead of =&model->m=

- All the headers renamed to remove =mrcal-= from their name. Everything is
  intended to be included as

  #+begin_src c
  #include <mrcal/thing.h>
  #+end_src

  So the =mrcal-= in the name was superfluous. If you were including either of:

  - =mrcal-image.h=
  - =mrcal-types.h=

  You should now include:

  - =mrcal/image.h=
  - =mrcal/types.h=

- The [[https://www.github.com/dkogan/mrcal/blob/master/image.h][=mrcal_image_anytype_load()=]] function uses the =mrcal_image_void_t= image
  type. The semantics are identical, but older code might need a cast or a type
  change to build.
